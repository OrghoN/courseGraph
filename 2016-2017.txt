Archaeology (ARC)
Advisors: Ellen Hoobler
Archaeology is a multi-disciplinary field that emphasizes the interpretation of material remains
in order to understand a culture's history, demographics, religions, economic exchange, political
systems, and social values. Archaeologists can specialize in traditionally scientific areas, such as
floral and faunal remains and forensic archaeology (biology), the chemical composition of
ceramics or preservation of delicate paintings (chemistry), or the petrology and geomorphology
of lithics and the ability to survey and map sites (geology). Archaeologists use computer
software to record and catalog data and to map, and sometimes reconstruct, ancient sites.
Historical archaeologists must be able to read coins, inscriptions, and the preserved writings of a
culture (languages). Finally, archaeologists need to be able to understand human interaction
(anthropology) suggested by the art and artifacts of a culture (art history). In short, to be a good
archaeologist, one needs a broad liberal arts education with emphases in one or more specific
areas.
Students may develop an individualized major in Archaeology by following the
recommendations given below and filing with the Registrar a Contract for an Individualized
Major. See Declaration of Degree Candidacy, Majors, and Minors, item 3c. For students
intending to attend graduate school in Archaeology, it is also highly recommended to have an
additional major or minor in a related discipline (e.g., Anthropology, Art History, Classical
Studies, Geology, History, Religion, or Spanish).
Archaeology faculty members: Rhawn Denniston, John Gruber-Miller, Ellen Hoobler, ,
Christina Penn-Goetsch, Philip Venticinque
Major: A minimum of eleven course credits, at least five of which must be at the 300/400 level,
from the following categories:
1. Core courses: ANT 101 (Cultural Anthropology), 110 (Introduction to Archaeology); two
courses in biology, chemistry, or geology; and language through 205.
2. Courses defined by Time and Place:

complement our readings of texts. Some readings are in English to provide background
historical and cultural information, but all primary texts are in French. Prerequisite: FRE 301 or
permission of the instructor. FRE 311 or 312 strongly recommended. Offered every third year.
(Humanities)
331. Enlightenment: Eighteenth Century French Literature
France’s fiercely secular understanding of citizenship can be traced back to the Enlightenment
period which culminated in the violent revolution of 1789. French philosophes such as Voltaire,
Rousseau, Diderot, and Montesquieu, united in their belief in the supreme power of human
reason, waged fierce opposition to the social and political constraints of religious authority that
undergirded the Old Regime and promoted an international republic of letters founded on
freedom of expression and human rights. This course focuses on works by the philosophes with
attention to the limits of French Enlightenment thinking with respect to differences of race and
gender. Alternative voices of important historical actors such as Olympe de Gouges, a feminist
abolitionist, and Toussaint l’Ouverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804, will also
be considered. Prerequisite: FRE 301. FRE311 or FRE 312 is strongly recommended. Offered
every third year. (Humanities)
353. Race and Immigration in French Film
Issues surrounding race and immigration are the focus of much attention in the United States,
and such issues are similarly important topics of discussion in France. However, the French
context of race and immigration varies from its American counterpart, and this means that
related questions are differently defined, constructed, and understood. France's long colonial
history plays no small part in generating and continuing conversations on the matters of race
and immigration, and its policy of assimilation vis à vis immigrants and (formerly) colonized
peoples has frequently resulted in debate, protest, and legislation. We will examine
constructions of race and portrayals of immigration in French-language films primarily from
France. Special attention will be paid to intersections of class and gender with race and
immigration. Readings will be provided to buttress understanding of the historical and social
contexts as well as to contribute to comprehension of some critical race theory. This course also
counts towards the GSS major. Prerequisite: FRE 301 or permission of the instructor. FRE 311
or 312 strongly recommended. Offered every third year. (Humanities)
354. Sporting Identities
What can an examination of sports tell us about national cultures and identities in the Frenchspeaking world? How do sports affect—and how are they affected by—gender, class, and race?
How do sports and sports narratives change over time and how does this influence the meanings
and messages they propagate or are made to carry? Do the same sports mean the same things
for different cultures, or even for different people? Through various literary and cultural texts—
photographs, films, short stories, non-fiction, etc.—we will examine the role of sports and sports
narratives in creating, resisting, shifting, or maintaining elements of cultures and identities.
Students do not need to have any familiarity with sports to take this class, but they do need to
have met the prerequisites for taking upper-level courses in French, as the course will be
conducted in French. Prerequisites: This course also counts towards the GSS major.
Prerequisite: FRE 301 or permission of the instructor. FRE 311 or 312 strongly recommended.

meet with the professor during the fall semester of their junior year to discuss the expectations
and process of the senior capstone research project. Work should be completed as a one-term
independent study course during the student’s senior year, and will culminate in a research
paper in French. If more than one student chooses to complete an independent capstone
research project in the same year, they may work concurrently during the same block in a
workshop model, discussing their work with both the professor and one another. NO S/U
option.

Computer Science (CSC)
Tony deLaubenfels, Ross Sowell (chair), Leon Tabak
The technology of computing has developed with unprecedented speed and offers the prospect
of continued rapid advance. Few technologies have so quickly become so pervasive. Few have so
profoundly changed science, business and industry, and government. Some understanding of
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

98

the potential and limitations of computing is essential to anyone who wishes to understand
modern society.
Design, experiment, and analysis: these skills make the computer scientist part engineer, part
scientist, and part mathematician. The student of computer science learns how to effectively
communicate with teammates and clients to define problems and their solutions. Students learn
how to divide a complex problem into pieces of manageable size, to organize and relate the
pieces of information that describe the problem, and to order the steps of the solution. The study
of computer science serves to increase a student's awareness of the necessity of constructing a
hierarchy of abstractions as a means of building and understanding complex machines, the
designer's need to give balanced consideration to competing goals, e.g., minimizing cost while
maximizing computational speed, and the relationship between software and hardware.
Major: A minimum of 10.25 course credits, including 9.25 in Computer Science; also MAT 120
or 121 (Calculus of a Single Variable). The courses in Computer Science must include CSC 140,
144, 151, 218, 301, 512 (capstone), and at least four other 300-level courses. One of the four
required 300-level courses may be an Internship, Individual Project, or Group Project. The
faculty strongly recommends additional study of mathematics and statistics, to include STA 201
(Statistical Methods I) and MAT 221 (Linear Algebra), for those students who intend to pursue
software engineering careers or continue their study of computer science at the graduate level.
Minor: MAT 120 or 121 (Calculus of a Single Variable) and a minimum of six course credits in
Computer Science which include CSC 140, 144, 151, 218, 301 and at least one other 300-level
course, excluding Internships, Individual Projects, and Group Projects.
131. The Beauty and Joy of Computing
Computing has changed the world in profound ways. It has opened up wonderful new ways for
people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. This course will focus
on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing that have changed the world and consider where it will
go in the future. We will discuss the challenges and implications of computer technology,
including the responsibilities of those who design and use computer systems. Students will learn
a bit about computer programming and a lot about writing at the college level. The lab portion of
the course will introduce students to computer programming using languages and development
tools designed for students with no programming experience.
140. Foundations of Computer Science
This course introduces students to problems that engage the interests of computer scientists and
define the field. The course introduces students to object-oriented design, a principal discipline
that computer scientists use to solve problems. Students learn to divide large problems into
small problems, bundle related data with methods that operate on that data, and incorporate
into new designs elements of previously completed designs. The course emphasizes creative
expression using an abstract notation. Students practice designing, writing, testing, and
presenting programs. Success in the course does not require previous programming experience.
144. Software Architecture
Disciplined design, coding, and testing of substantial programs. Specification of relationships
among components of a program using composition and inheritance. Discernment of a client's
requirements. Evaluation of the communication between a computer program and its human
user. Prerequisite: CSC 140.

functions from hardware to software, or vice versa. Prerequisites: CSC 140 and 151.
222. Geographic Information Systems
This course introduces students to computer science through a study of one of its important
applications. Through work on projects related to their major fields of interest, students will
learn how to use the visualization and statistical functions of geographic information systems as
aids in making decisions. Students will learn how to represent, analyze, and display geographic
data. Case studies will familiarize students with applications of the technology in the natural
sciences, public policy, business, and other fields. Readings, discussions, and exercises will

171. Gender, Power, and Identity
This interdisciplinary core course in the program analyzes how notions of race, gender,
sexuality, class, nation, physical ability and other aspects of social location materially influence
people’s lives. To conduct our analysis, we will consider various strands of feminism, divergent
positions among queer theorists, and arguments drawn from other identity based fields (e.g
ethnic studies, American studies, postcolonial studies) in order to survey and compare several
perspectives on gender, race, sexuality, race and class. Placing gender and sexuality at the center
of analysis, we will address some of the basic concepts in Gender, Sexualities and Women’s
Studies. We will also explore questions regarding incorporating other social categories such as
race, ethnicity, class and nationality. Throughout the course we will complete readings, watch
films, and engage in exercises to explore the past, present and potential future understandings
about gender and sexuality, paying close attention to political, cultural, and economic contexts.
180-181. Introductory Topics: Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies
See Topics Courses.
270. Social Justice Perspectives and Practices
Intersectional and interdisciplinary exploration of feminist and other social justice perspectives
and practices relevant to understanding and responding to social oppression. Course
discussions focus on power, privilege, oppression, and implications for social change. Activities
and assignments focus on using social justice remedies or ‘tools,’ such as individual resistance,
policy, advocacy, and social action, and collective struggle to propose solutions to contemporary
problems. Areas studied might include critical race theory and critical race feminism, queer
theory, women of color feminisms, transnational/global feminisms, disability studies, liberation
theory, postcolonial theory, feminist ‘locational’ theories. Specific topics vary by instructor.

153. Origins of the American Nation
From colonial origins through Reconstruction, with emphasis on the formation of local,
sectional, and national communities. Not open to seniors without permission of the instructor.
No S/U option. (Humanities)
154. Making of Modern America
The late nineteenth century ushered in a plethora of momentous changes in the economic,
political, and social spheres of American life that heralded the birth of modern society. Massive
upheavals brought about by revolutions in American industry, transportation systems,
immigration patterns, and urbanization fundamentally altered the very structure of American
society. This course examines the underlying changes that gave rise to a new era in American
history epitomized by the "mass" character of modern life by focusing on mass production, mass
consumption, mass culture, and mass movements (including civil rights and women's rights)
from the mid-nineteenth century through the late 1960s. Not open to seniors without
permission of the instructor. No S/U option. (Humanities)
210. Warfare and Society in Modern Times
Changes in military conflict from the eighteenth century to the present. Interaction of warfare
and social values. No S/U option. (Humanities)
220. History of Spain, 700-1600
This course examines Spanish history from the Arab invasion through its “Golden Age.” The two
major themes that this course explores are 1) the shift from a frontier society to a colonial
empire, and 2) the multi-religious, multi-cultural nature of Iberian society during this period.
The course examines the dynamics of violence, competition, and coexistence, between Muslims,
Christians, and Jews, as well as within Muslim and Christian society. How did those dynamics,
and the ideology of Reconquest, shape Spanish society and Spain’s early colonial efforts? How
has this period of Spanish history been remembered and interpreted? (Humanities)
221. Trials and Transitions of the Renaissance
This course explores the political, social, and religious changes of the Renaissance period
(roughly, 1400-1600) through immersive simulations in which students adopt the personas of
historical individuals. Topics may include Florentine politics, the Reformation Parliament called
by Henry VIII, and others. (Humanities)
240. Public Memory and Public History
The American public has an insatiable appetite for representations of the nation's past, as
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

138

demonstrated by the popularity of historic sites, museums, historical re-enactments, televised
historical documentaries and Hollywood films. Yet, despite its growing audience, the discipline
of history seems to be in a state of crisis. Political debates have engendered a public furor over
how American history is being taught and remembered. This course will examine the often
contentious relationship between popular presentations of the past for the general public and
professional historians' scholarly interpretations and provide an introduction to the growing
field of museum studies. The course may include the "hands-on" experience of a mini-internship
at local historical societies, libraries, and museums and the opportunity for students to create
their own online exhibits on different historical topics. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or
permission of the Instructor. Alternate years. No S/U option. (Humanities)
241. Slavery and the Environment in a Comparative Context (in the Bahamas)
This course offers a rare opportunity to explore historic slave plantation ruins on a remote
island in the Bahamas as a means of interpreting the history of slavery. We will examine the
attempt by British Loyalists, who left the American colonies after the Revolutionary War, to
establish cotton production in the Bahamas, using slave labor, and how the environmental
context led to significant differences in the evolving relationships between enslaved people and
plantation owners. A significant portion of the course (two weeks) will be conducted at the
Gerace Research Centre, College of the Bahamas on the island of San Salvador; this will enable
us to explore the ruins of several slave plantations, including the Farquharson Plantation. The
journal Charles Farquharson kept from 1831-1832, which includes a slave uprising, is the only
one in existence documenting a Bahamian slave plantation, and will be a central course text.
This course is cross-listed with Environmental Studies. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor.
(Humanities)

252. Baseball: The American Game
In many interesting ways the history of baseball from the mid-1800’s onward reflects the history
of the United States. This seminar will examine the origins of the game, its evolution to a
professional sport and then big business, legal aspects of the game, integration, and
unionization. Students will write several papers and do a little research project about baseball
and American society. Find out how Cornelius McGillicuddy, Jackie Robinson, Alexander
Cartwright, Curt Flood, John Montgomery Ward, Alta Weiss, and Andy Messersmith –
ballplayers all – reveal something important about American history and society. The
relationship of the national game to changes in the country such as industrialization,
urbanization, labor unionism, and integration. No S/U option. (Humanities)

Music Lessons at Cornell: Students register for Solo Performance courses (music lessons) at
the beginning of Term One and Term Five. These courses are taught over four consecutive
terms. Registration entails additional costs (see Music Lessons, Fees*). Students may withdraw
from these courses only during the first of the four terms. If a student withdraws from a Solo
Performance course during the drop period, he or she will be charged only for the lessons
scheduled between the beginning of the course and the date when the course is officially
dropped and no entry concerning the course will appear on the student's transcript. After the
drop period has passed, if a student ceases to attend, a grade of F will appear on the student's
transcript and the student will be billed for the full semester charge. All music scholarship
students must be enrolled in music lessons to retain their scholarships. For students graduating
before 2017: after a student has earned more than one course credit in the continuing study of
the same instrument, he or she may count the additional credits toward the fulfillment of the
general B.A. requirement for a minimum of eight courses numbered in the 300s or 400s.

three prepared works; scales; arpeggios; sight reading; and melody harmonization. Also, as part
of the requirement, Music Education majors must demonstrate their ability to perform an
accompaniment with a singer or instrumentalist. A student may pass the requirement in
segments.
Aural Skills Proficiency Requirement:
All BA and BM Music majors must pass the Aural Skills Proficiency Requirement in order to
complete the Music Major. These students must pass each of a series of graduated exams (3
levels required for the BA; 4 levels required for the BM) that test in the following Aural Skills
areas: intervals, chords, scales, melodic dictation, harmonic dictation, and sight singing. These
topics will be taught both within the four required Music Theory courses, as well as in a longerterm self-paced, computer-program-assisted, proficiency-based mode.
Ensemble Participation: Participation in large music ensembles (MUS 712, 713, 715, 716, and
717) is required of all Music majors and music scholarship students, regardless of degree or
program. Requirements vary, depending on the degree program. The student must perform
within an ensemble on his/her primary instrument unless otherwise approved by the
Department of Music. Pianists must complete one full-credit from the large ensembles (712, 713,
714, 715, 716) before they may count MUS 719 or MUS 711 as their primary ensemble credit.
Only pianists may use 719 or 711 to fulfill an ensemble requirement. Regulations governing
adding and dropping ensembles are the same as for Music Lessons, with the exception of MUS
718.
Music Performance Seminar: The Music Performance Seminar (MUS 701) is a semesterlong program that consists of attendance at music events. The purpose of this Seminar is to help
nurture an understanding of diverse musical styles and musical ensembles and to provide
opportunities for student performances. Attendance at concerts, recitals, and Friday afternoon
Music Performance Seminar Student Recitals is required of all Music majors and minors, as well
as all other students who are enrolled in music lessons. (Students who have accepted a Music
Scholarship must satisfy, at minimum, the recital attendance requirement for a Music minor.)
The number of required events changes from semester to semester. Students should contact the
Department of Music each semester for details. Music majors must receive a passing grade in
Music Performance Seminar (MUS 701) in a minimum of five semesters in order to complete the
major. Failure to meet the attendance requirement will result in the student's receiving an F for
Music Performance Seminar. No course credit is given for this Seminar. It is offered on a
Pass/Fail basis.

Philosophy (PHI)
Paul Gray, Genevieve Migely (chair), Jim White
Essential to a liberal education is the ability to think, to detect bad arguments and evidence, to
see more than one side of a matter and to decide which is best, to construct a coherent case, and
to make words perform their tasks with clarity and precision. These principles, along with a
concern for representing the principal areas of philosophical inquiry, and an emphasis on the
careful, creative, and critical reading of important philosophical texts, guide the Department in
planning its curriculum.
Major: A minimum of nine course credits, which include PHI 111 and 202; either 203 or 204;

105. Topics in Philosophy
109. Ethics and Climate Change (FYS)
The threat of climate change raises urgent questions about what we ought to do—i.e., questions
about morality. We will spend some time considering climate science and questions raised by
controversy about that science. What should we believe about the claim that human activity is
threatening the climatic stability of our planet given apparent disagreement about the truth of
that hypothesis. We will also spend time considering the moral challenges the risk of climate
change generates: what is the nature of our obligations to prevent harm to people distant in
space and in time; what responsibilities do nations of the industrialized world have to respond
to threats generated by climate change; what does it make sense for such nations to do given the
uncertainty of some outcomes of climate change; what should we, as individual citizens of such
nations, be doing? We will read material of all sorts about these questions—we’ll look at
scientific reports, economic analyses, and philosophical/ethical arguments, for example—and
talk and write about what we make of the issues. Seminar for first year students only. (First Year
Seminar)

a literature search on the background of their experiment in more depth and then write an
individualized paper, with emphasis on their particular contribution to the project. The paper
must be submitted to their capstone advisor no later than two blocks after the start of the
advanced lab. The student will revise the paper until it is accepted by the department. If it
appears that the student is making insufficient progress towards the completion of the
individual paper, then the student and Registrar will be notified that the student is in danger of
not completing the major requirements. Once the paper is approved, students are then required
to present their findings in a public presentation. If the presentation is judged unacceptable,
then the student will have the opportunity to give another presentation privately to the
department.

General
111. Introduction to Politics
Although you may not realize it, every one of us is involved in politics on a daily basis. We each
have experienced parents and children haggling over the rules governing curfew or use of the
car, employees and bosses negotiating behaviors at work, and organized crime families
disputing turf wars (ok, maybe not that last one). Yet, in one way or another, politics is a part of
our lives regardless of whether we are interested in Congress, political parties, or international
negotiations. Politics is the process by which individuals and groups reach agreements on a
course of joint action--even if they disagree on the intended goals of that action. This class
discusses the problems that groups need to overcome to reach agreements on a joint course of
action, and looks at the political institutions and other political processes and incentives that
enable groups to overcome those barriers here in the United States and internationally. (Social
Science)
216. Education Policy and Practice
This course will explore education policies and their relationship to sociological patterns of
school resegregation, the rise of credentialism, the end of educational expansion, and inequality
of educational opportunity. Students in the course will be introduced to the history of
policymaking in education beginning with the education reform policies of Horace Mann.
Students will also examine demographic data on educational attainment, analyze the policies
that alleviate or reinforce educational inequality, and describe what assumptions lie behind
current reform ideas. We will evaluate the dynamics of current debates by referencing the longstanding tensions among the different purposes of schooling we have in our nation. Same course

disputes, how it maximizes welfare and wealth, how it is structured, who decides what we mean
by law and how it functions, who decides what the societal interest is and whether it trumps
what an individual wishes to do. (Social Science)

equilibrium, the Heckscher-Ohlin model, imperfect competition, import-substitution vs. exportorientation, strategic trade theory, balance of payments, aggregate demand, the StolperSamuelson theorem, and other concepts, methods, and theorems) to sustain an economically
informed discussion of the political constraints upon and political implications of international
exchange of goods and currencies. I have often noted that the class covers a large part of the
same economic material as ECB 223 (International Economics), though we constantly direct our
attention to the questions of what political constraints preclude or modify the outcomes
economists expect and how economic developments favor and constrain the desires of domestic
political actors. The class also has a substantial focus upon the political constraints upon
economic development, that highlights the very important interactions between these economic
and political science concepts in a particular policy area that is often of interest to students.
Thus, the focus of the class is upon questions that are of interest to both economists and political
scientists, and my hope is that our attention to the interaction between economics and politics –
each viewed through the disciplinary lenses best adapted to understanding them – will help my
students understand the value of using multiple disciplinary approaches to approach problems.

Human behavior is at the root of almost all environmental problems: We drive gas guzzling cars
(contributing to both global warming and depletion of natural resources), produce tons of
refuse, deplete water resources (build golf courses in the desert). This course explores facets of
psychology that can help explain why we act as we do and how we might change behavior toward
greater sustainability. We review some basic psychological principles as they apply to the
environment: What are the thinking processes that lead some people to accept and others to
reject concepts like global warming? How do people develop their basic value systems, and how
do things like emotions and culture impact this? Even when people want to change their
behaviors, what are the barriers that make change difficult? Course includes an analysis and
application of these principles to a local issue. (First Year Seminar)
244. Human Aggression and Violence (W)

101. Sociological Thinking
Do you wonder why people do the things they do? Why society works as it does? Ever think the
world is “unfair”? Sociologists study people in the world, looking at patterns, at differences, at
inequalities. Thinking sociologically is like “entering a new and unfamiliar society--one in which
things are no longer what they seem.” It creates “culture shock without geographical
displacement.” This course requires us to look at society with a new perspective, to question our
taken-for-granted assumptions, to investigate people's actions, and to explore the organization
of society. It provides a basis for being engaged citizens, thinking about social alternatives, and
imagining possibilities for social justice. Credit may be given for either 101 or 102, but not for
both. Not open to seniors without permission of the instructor. (Social Science)
102. Topics in Sociological Thinking
The course is a version of Sociological Thinking (SOC 101) with a more specific topic focus. See
