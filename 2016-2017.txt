Educational Priorities at Cornell College
The Mission and Core Values guide learning at Cornell College. The College recognizes that
meaningful education occurs in multiple formats and venues, and encompasses a wide variety of
disciplines and learning objectives. As an intentional learning community, the College has
chosen to emphasize the following Educational Priorities and Outcomes for all students. In
order to achieve these Outcomes, the Educational Priorities are embedded in curricular, cocurricular, independent, and collaborative contexts across the campus. Faculty and staff provide
opportunities for learning in a supportive environment where students ultimately take
responsibility for their own education.
Educational Priorities

Knowledge

Students will…
integrate and apply knowledge from a focused area of study as
well as a broad general education which includes disciplinary
and interdisciplinary perspectives in the arts, humanities,
sciences, and social sciences.

Inquiry

respond to the complexities of contemporary and enduring
problems using information literacy tools, research skills,
creative thinking, and analysis.

Reasoning

evaluate evidence; interpret data; and use logical,
mathematical, and statistical problem-solving tools.

Communication

speak and write clearly, listen and read actively, and engage
with others in productive dialogue.

Intercultural Literacy

connect with diverse ideas and with people whose experiences
differ from their own and that may be separated from them by
time, space, or culture.

Ethical Behavior

recognize personal, academic, and professional standards and
act with integrity.

Citizenship

collaborate with others and contribute in their communities
and the larger world.

Vocation

discover and prepare for the range of opportunities and
challenges that await them beyond their college experience.

Well-Being

respect the ways physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual
well-being may contribute to a balanced life.

Effective Catalogue
[Note: This Catalogue is accurate as of August 1, 2016.]
The Cornell College Catalogue is published every year. The information contained herein was
accurate at the time of publication; however, circumstances may necessitate the College's
withdrawing an advertised course, changing the content of a course, or substituting instructors.
The College reserves the right to limit the enrollment of any course and to cancel a course for
which fewer than six students have registered or for which no instructor is available.
Between editions, the College may change or revise the programs, rules, and procedures
described in this Catalogue. Students are subject to the regulations and requirements in the
Catalogue and its supplements in effect at the time they begin their first course at Cornell. A
Cornell student who leaves and is later readmitted returns under the Catalogue in effect at the
time of readmission.
If, after a student has begun her or his Cornell career, one or more of the degree requirements
are changed, the student may choose to be graduated under either the original or the revised
requirements, unless specific faculty legislation dictates otherwise. Exceptions may be granted
for compelling reasons by the Academic Standing Committee or by the administrator concerned.
For the application of this "grandparent" principle to a student's major, see Declaration of
Degree Candidacy, Majors and Minors.
The offerings for each academic year are announced the previous winter in the Course Schedule,
which is then updated as often as is necessary.

Accreditation
Cornell College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Iowa
State Department of Education, the American Chemical Society, and the
University Senate of the United Methodist Church. Cornell is a member of
the College Entrance Examination Board.

"Off-Campus Programs"). Members are Beloit, Carleton, Coe, Colorado College, Cornell,
Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Luther, Macalester, Monmouth, Ripon, and St. Olaf.

One Course At A Time
The quality and intensity of a Cornell education is supported by the OCAAT calendar, where
students take one course at a time. A general overview of Cornell's One Course At A Time
program follows, with greater details provided in the Academic Information chapter.
1. The academic year, approximately September 1 to mid-May, is divided into eight Blocks,
each of which is three-and-one-half weeks (18 class days) in length. Each Block begins at
9:00 a.m. on the first Monday and concludes at 5:00 p.m. on the fourth Wednesday with the
exception of Block Four, which may be adjusted due to Thanksgiving Break and/or Winter
Break. A four-day break separates each Block, unless there is a winter or spring break. (See
the calendar for exact dates.)
2. Readmitted students may enroll at the start of any of the eight Blocks but should apply at
least one month before–and earlier if they desire financial aid or on-campus housing. (See
Readmission.)
3. Enrolled students register in the spring for all eight Blocks of the following academic year.
After registration, students may drop and add courses throughout the year. (See
Registration and Adding and Dropping Courses.)
4. Cornell offers three degree programs: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.),
and Bachelor of Special Studies (B.S.S.), each of which requires a minimum of 31 course
credits. (See Degree Programs.)
5. Progress toward any of Cornell's degrees is measured in Blocks or course credits. One course
credit is given for the successful completion of a Cornell course taken in a Block. Course
credits include Block credits and credits from adjunct courses, music lessons and ensembles,
advanced placement, and transferred work. As a unit of credit, one Cornell Block or "full
course" credit is the equivalent of four semester or six quarter hours. (See Student
Classification and Credit by Transfer.)
6. Full-time students register for eight Blocks in the academic year. Except for seniors, students
may not take vacation Blocks in an academic year without permission of the Academic
Standing Committee. (See Registration.) This paragraph does not apply to Continuing
Education students.
7. The maximum amount of credit that a student may earn in one Block is one "full course"
credit. Conversely, students, with the exception of seniors and candidates for the degree of
Bachelor of Music, are not permitted to enroll for less than a "full course" credit per Block.
Some departments offer concurrent courses, each of which is worth one-half course credit.
Concurrent courses must, therefore, be taken in pairs and within the same department or in
a related field. Exceptions must be approved by the Academic Standing Committee.
8. Students have many opportunities for independent research on or off campus, for
internships, and for study in other countries or in other parts of the United States. Such
programs vary in length from one Block to one year, and some may be arranged for the
summer. (See Registration, and item 10 therein; and also Independent Study Courses and
Off-Campus Programs.)

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

10

9. Adjunct courses (numbered in the 500s) and music lessons, ensembles, and theatre
participation courses (numbered in the 700s) may be taken along with principal courses.
(See Adjunct Courses.)
10. Students declare their choice of degree program and major(s) before December 1 of their
sophomore year. Students may major in one or more departments or design their own
individualized majors. (See Degree Candidacy, Majors and Minors, and Bachelor of Special
Studies.)
11. Unless otherwise noted, Continuing Education students are subject to the academic rules
listed above; however, there are special exceptions that apply to them. (See Continuing
Education.)

Student Status
A person becomes an enrolled student at Cornell College when s/he moves into college housing,
begins college-sponsored activities or on the first day of a course for which s/he is registered,
whichever occurs first. A person ceases to be a student on the last day of the last course for
which s/he is registered, ends involvement with college-sponsored activities or when s/he moves
out of campus housing, whichever occurs later.

Affirmative Action
Cornell College is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer and is committed to an
Affirmative Action Program. In compliance with federal and state laws, Cornell College affirms
the right of its students, faculty, and staff to live, work, and study in an environment free from
discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity, national
origin, race, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other
characteristic protected by state, federal, or local law. Neither may applicants for employment
nor enrollment be discriminated against based on the above characteristics.

Notice of Nondiscriminatory Policy
Cornell admits qualified persons - without regard to age, ancestry, color, disability, sex, gender
identity, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or genetic information - to all the
rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at
Cornell. The College does not discriminate in the administration of its educational or admissions
policies, scholarships and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.

Student Consumer Grievance Process
Beginning July 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Education regulations to improve the integrity of
programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) as amended (the
“Program Integrity Rule”) took effect. The Program Integrity Rule requires, among other things,
that each college or university authorized to offer postsecondary education in one or more states
ensure access to a complaint (grievance) process that will permit student consumers to address
the following:
1. Alleged violations of state consumer protection laws that include, but are not limited to,
fraud and false advertising;
2. Alleged violations of state laws or rules relating to the licensure of postsecondary
institutions; and
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

11

3. Complaints regarding the quality of education or other State or accreditation
requirements.
Cornell College, as an institution authorized to provide postsecondary education
in the State of Iowa, is committed to full compliance with the Program Integrity
Rule. The College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Information about the College’s
accreditation can be found at the HLC website.
Cornell College seeks to resolve all student concerns in a timely and effective manner. Students
have the right to file a grievance against Cornell College. Students may file a grievance up to 120
calendar days from the date of the incident. Students may not file anonymously.
A grievance alleges that the College or one of its agents has violated institutional policies,
accreditor policies, federal or state laws, or any other agreements joined by Cornell College.
Grounds for a grievance include failures in the provision of a program of study or related
academic or administrative service, or institutional policies that negatively affect the quality of a
student’s learning opportunities. Grievances fall outside of standard College processes (e.g.,
grade dispute process, conduct appeals, etc.), as outlined in the Cornell College Academic
Catalogue, The Compass, the Faculty Handbook, or the Employee Handbook, and require that
students have already first exhausted established Cornell College processes and mechanisms to
address their concern.

Grievance Resolution Process
Any student who believes they have been subject to unjust actions or denied of their
rights is expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve the matter before seeking formal
resolution. The student should request a meeting with the parties directly involved,
describing the nature of the grievance and a desirable resolution. Both parties are
encouraged to try to find a reasonable and satisfactory resolution.
The following offices and resources at Cornell College are available to current and
prospective students for the resolving of grievances. These offices provide specific
administrative means to address and resolve most, if not all, of the questions and
concerns students may have.
•
•
•
•

Registrar’s Office (academic concerns): Becki Elkins, belkins@cornellcollege.edu,
319-895-4372
Dean of Students (student affairs concerns): Gwen Schimek,
gschimek@cornellcollege.edu, 319-895-4234

mbeamer@cornellcollege.edu, 319-895-4242
Admissions (enrollment concerns): Sharon Grice, sgrice@cornellcollege.edu, 319895-4215

If the parties involved in the grievance are unable to find a satisfactory resolution and
further action is deemed appropriate, students must follow the procedures outlined in
the following process:
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

12

1. Students wishing to file a grievance against Cornell College may do so by completing
the online Student Grievance Form. Students can also file a grievance by speaking
with one of the following, designated personnel and completing a Student Grievance
Form:
• Academic concerns: Registrar
• Student Affairs concerns: Dean of Students
• Financial/billing concerns: Controller
• Enrollment/Financial Aid concerns: Director of Admission Operations
Students’ confidentiality will be protected within reason, but officials of the College
may require access to students’ educational records in order to fully investigate the
grievance. Students who are initiating a grievance against Cornell College must
authorize release of information necessary to investigate the grievance.
2. The student will receive, within 5 business days, a written response from the
designated personnel relevant to their grievance, including a determination of
whether the issue/incident constitutes a grievance according to Cornell College’s
policy and definition. If the issue/incident submitted does not constitute a grievance
according to Cornell College’s policy and definition, the student will be informed in
writing, and the College process will be considered concluded.
3. If the issue/incident submitted constitutes a grievance, according to Cornell College’s
policy and definition, the designated personnel will meet with the student and any
other relevant parties to discuss the issue/incident which led to the filing of the
grievance. Any meetings pertaining to the investigation of the grievance will be
conducted as quickly as possible and generally will be concluded within 10 business
days of the determination of a grievance.
4. The designated personnel, in consultation with the appropriate Vice President(s),
will identify (an) appropriate resolution(s), generally within 10 business days of the
close of the investigation. The designated personnel will inform the student in
writing of the resolution(s). Decisions regarding resolutions are not subject to
internal appeal.
5. The entire process will generally be concluded within 30 business days of the initial
receipt of the grievance.
6. Students have the right to obtain legal counsel.

Grievances Addressed to External Agencies
If a student believes that the College’s administrative procedures outlined above have not
adequately addressed concerns identified under the Program Integrity Rule, they may
pursue an external process. Students may file a grievance against the College with
relevant state and federal agencies including, but not limited to, the Higher Learning
Commission, the Iowa College Student Aid Commission, the Iowa Attorney General, and
the Office of Civil Rights. Please note that many agencies require students to first
exhaust their college’s grievance procedures before filing a grievance with the agency.
We recommend that students refer to the individual agency’s policies to familiarize
themselves with relevant requirements including filing deadlines and whether they must
first pursue the College’s grievance process.
The available agencies are listed on the following page.

DEGREE AND PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS
General Requirements for Degree Programs
The College encourages the creative structuring of a student's educational experiences by
offering a choice of three degree programs within the framework of a liberal education. These
programs, of equal validity and in accord with the aims of the College, are intended to
accommodate each student's abilities, interests, and needs. Programs range from a traditional
curriculum of course requirements, designed to ensure both breadth and depth, to a nontraditional combination of courses, independent studies, and internships that meet specific
goals. For the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees, the goals have been set by the
Faculty. The Bachelor of Special Studies permits the student to define her or his own
educational objectives and to select the methods best suited to achieving them. To be eligible to
receive any one of the three degrees described below, students must:
1. be admitted to degree candidacy by the Dean of Admission. All students are admitted to
Cornell as candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts and remain B.A. candidates,
regardless of their intention, until they have filed for and been officially granted admission
to another degree program.
2. file an application for graduation no later than October 1 of their senior year for graduation
at the end of Block Four, Block Eight, or August of that academic year and have a conference
with the Registrar. By filing this application for graduation, students formally declare their
desire to be graduated during that academic year and register how they wish their name to
appear on their diploma. Once the student has applied for graduation, an official audit of all
credits earned and in progress will be conducted by the Registrar. The Registrar will inform
the student and her or his academic advisor(s) of the requirements to be completed. No
further check is made by the Registrar until after the start of the student's last Block at
Cornell. The student, therefore, is responsible for fulfilling the conditions stated on the audit
and for consulting the Registrar before changing any of the courses for which he or she was
registered at the time the audit was done. Students who will be off campus during all or part
of their senior year must reconfirm their status and credits with the Registrar at least one
month before Commencement.
3. complete all the requirements for their degree program prior to Commencement, and settle
their financial obligations to the College before the Monday preceding Commencement.
Even though a student may complete the required work immediately following
Commencement or during the succeeding summer, her or his degree will not be conferred
nor a diploma awarded retroactively.
4. earn, at the very least, eight of their final 10 course credits in Blocks taken on the Cornell
College campus from Cornell College faculty members unless granted permission by the
Academic Standing Committee to participate in (1) a Combined Degrees Program, (2) an offcampus program approved by Cornell, or (3) an off-campus independent study supervised
by a Cornell faculty member. Students who are admitted or readmitted with senior standing
(23 or more course credits) must complete at least eight course credits at Cornell. If they
intend to be graduated in fewer than 10 Blocks, at least six of the eight course credits must
be earned in courses numbered in the 300s or 400s, exclusive of all such courses in English
as a Second Language. (See also Credit by Transfer)

5. be recommended by formal vote of the Faculty and approved by the Board of Trustees on the
basis of their satisfactory academic achievement and good campus citizenship, in accordance
with the bylaws of the college.
Although it is possible for a student to satisfy the requirements for more than one degree
program, the College will not grant two degrees for programs taken concurrently. A graduate
who returns and completes a minimum of eight course credits beyond whatever number was
accumulated for the first baccalaureate may qualify for a different Cornell degree. For
information on completing an additional major or minor after graduation, see Declaration of
Degree Candidacy.

Bachelor of Arts
Cornell College is committed to sustaining a community devoted to liberal learning and
democratic values. The Bachelor of Arts degree encourages Cornell students to explore liberal
learning as it is practiced in different disciplines. The specific degree requirements follow a
traditional, structured program, designed and approved by the faculty. The degree is best suited
for students who want a broad education, or for those students who have not yet decided on a
specific educational path. For this reason, all students are placed in the B.A. program when they
enter Cornell until they choose another degree program. Also, the B.A. insists that the student
not over-specialize in any one field by requiring that the student complete at least 17 courses
outside of any one specific department.

Bachelor of Arts Requirements for Candidates who will graduate in
2017 or later. (For graduates prior to 2017 please see previous years’
catalogue.)
Overview:
1. Introduction to college-level expectations and the disciplines:
a. A First-year Program that introduces students to college-level
expectations. These courses may focus on a specific discipline, but their
primary purpose is to introduce students to the kinds of questions and
methods they will encounter, and to the skills they will develop, in the next
four years. Both a writing and a First Year Seminar course must be taken in
the first year. These courses do not count toward the distribution
requirements.
b. Distribution requirements that introduce students to the methods and
practices of the arts, natural sciences, social sciences, mathematics,
humanities, and language study. One or two courses cannot give students a
deep appreciation and understanding of any one subject; the college expects
students to use these courses as an opportunity to explore different
disciplines and to develop an understanding of the different approaches to
problem solving and different methods of understanding ourselves and our
world. These courses may count toward major requirements.
2. Study in depth, including at least one major field of study.
The specific degree requirements are:
1. A minimum of 31 course credits. No more than two 100-level courses may be taken in
the senior year without the permission of the Academic Standing Committee. No

more than four All-College Independent Study course credits (280/380, 289/389,
290/390, 297/397, 299/399) may be counted toward satisfying the minimum credit
requirement for this degree. No more than two full credits in 500-level adjunct
courses may be counted toward satisfying the minimum 31 credits.
Of the minimum 31 course credits, at least 17 must be outside of any single
department. Students who exceed 14 credits in one department will be required to
take more than 31 credits to complete their degree in order to have at least 17 credits
outside that department. In the calculation of departmental credits, the following
disciplines, listed for administrative purposes as divisions of single departments, are
reckoned as separate departments: Anthropology, Classics, Communications Studies,
English as a Second Language, Arabic, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Language
and Linguistics, Latin, Russian, Sociology, Spanish, and Theatre.
A cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher.
At least one departmental, interdisciplinary, or individualized major.

Bachelor of Music
Cornell offers two majors leading to the degree of Bachelor of Music: a major in Performance
and a major in Music Education. The first is designed to emphasize the study of music
performance within the framework of the liberal arts and is the first step in the extensive
professional preparation in performance that leads to a concert career or to teaching applied
music in a college, university, conservatory, or private studio. The second generally leads to the
profession of pre-collegiate school music teaching. For students interested in fields such as
music therapy, music ministry, or community music, a major in Music Education is strongly
recommended by some graduate schools and required by others. Students interested in
pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Music will find these requirements listed under “Music,” in the
Courses of Study.

General Requirements for the Bachelor of Music Degree
1. A minimum of 31 course credits. No more than two 100-level courses may be taken in
the senior year without the permission of the Academic Standing Committee. No
more than four All-College Independent Study course credits (280/380, 289/389,
290/390, 297/397, 299/399) may be counted toward satisfying the minimum credit
requirement for this degree. No more than two full credit in 500-level adjunct
courses may be counted toward satisfying the minimum 31 credits.
2. A cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher.
3. A minimum of 10 courses from outside the music department, to include a writingdesignated course (W) and three humanities courses (not counting the W course)
from at least two of the following groupings: (1) English and Foreign Language; (2)
History; (3) Philosophy; (4) Religion; (5) Art or Theatre; and (6) Education.
4. Music Theory: MUS 110, 210, 310, and 343.
5. Music History: MUS 321, 322, and 323.

sophomore year) and complete coursework for elementary certification and /or
secondary certification as described under Education. Prospective teachers should
request a current list of the specific course requirements from the Education Office.

Bachelor of Special Studies
The Bachelor of Special Studies degree offers Cornell students the opportunity to design their
own liberal arts degree program in order to meet their particular educational goals. This
opportunity permits students to combine courses in an individualized fashion and to broaden or
deepen their studies beyond the traditional framework of the Bachelor of Arts. Accordingly, the
B.S.S. has no general education requirements and no restrictions as to either the number of
courses that may be taken in any one department or the level of such courses, or even that a
student complete traditional course work. Moreover, while students pursuing a B.S.S. degree
may complete one or more departmental, interdisciplinary, or individualized majors, they are
not required to complete an academic major.
The particular requirements for the Bachelor of Special Studies degree are:
• complete a minimum of 31 course credits;
• achieve a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher;
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

19

•
•

file for candidacy by submitting the Prospectus at any time after October 1 of the sophomore
year; and
complete a minimum of 12 course credits after the Prospectus is approved. (Transfer
students admitted with senior standing must complete a minimum of six course credits.)

The Bachelor of Special Studies degree is defined by the Prospectus, a detailed plan outlining the
student's B.S.S. degree program. The Prospectus incorporates a narrative description of the
program and a chronology of courses that will be taken by the student to fulfill the goals
outlined in the narrative description. The Prospectus is to be written by the student, reviewed
and signed by a faculty committee composed of a primary advisor and two readers, and filed
with the Registrar, who verifies that it is complete and that it meets current academic
regulations as set forth by the Faculty. The signed Prospectus is considered an agreement
between the student and the College.
Course changes that involve substitution of courses accomplishing the same goals as courses
originally projected require only an add/drop form. However, significant deviations from the
program outlined in the Prospectus must be justified in a letter to the Registrar written by the
student and approved by the student's B.S.S. faculty committee before the student may change
the agreement. Significant deviations would include:
• a shift in emphasis or direction of the program of study;
• the addition or deletion of a major or minor;
• a decrease in the ratio of upper-level to lower-level courses; or
• the substitution of three or more independent studies or internships for scheduled courses.
If you have questions concerning the Bachelor of Special Studies degree, please contact the
Registrar or your academic advisor.

Instructions and General Information for Students Contemplating
the Bachelor of Special Studies
1. Obtain a copy of the guidelines for the Narrative and the Chronology at the end of
your first or the beginning of your second year (available in the Registrar's Office and
on the web site at http://www.cornellcollege.edu/registrar).
2. Discuss your proposed B.S.S. program with your advisor or one or more members of
the faculty.
3. Choose a committee of three faculty members including a primary advisor who will
help you create your B.S.S. program and two faculty readers who, along with your
primary advisor, will review and sign your Prospectus. The primary advisor and
faculty readers must either be members of the full-time teaching faculty or part-time
members who have been selected by the Department or Program to advise B.S.S.
students. Some departments may choose certain members to advise all of their B.S.S.
students. If you declare one or more majors, your primary advisor must be a member
of a department in which you will have a major.
4. In conjunction with your primary advisor, begin planning your B.S.S. program prior
to registering for your junior year. Write a 500-1,000 word Narrative and complete
the Chronology. Rewrite until your primary advisor gives initial approval to your
Prospectus.
5. Circulate your Prospectus to two faculty readers and schedule a group meeting with
your primary advisor and your two faculty readers. After this review, your faculty
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

20

committee may either approve and sign your Prospectus, or suggest revisions to
strengthen it. If revisions are suggested, rewrite and re-circulate the revised
document to each of your three committee members for their approval. Once
approved, the Prospectus must be signed by each member of the faculty committee
and filed with the Registrar, who will verify that it is complete and meets current
academic regulations as set forth by the Faculty.
Your faculty committee will evaluate the Prospectus according to these criteria:
o Is it technically well-written (grammar, spelling, organization)?
o Is it conceptually well-written (articulation of program clear, goals achievable,
means reasonable)?
o Is the Chronology consistent with the Narrative?
o Is the plan consistent with the educational priorities of the College?
o Are the activities outside the classroom, in BSS 690 Blocks or other experiences,
consistent with the Narrative and the Chronology?
6. File your Prospectus with the Registrar any time after October 1 of your sophomore
year. If it is complete and found to conform to current academic regulations, the
Registrar will notify you of its approval. The Prospectus will become part of your
permanent file at the College.
7. You must obtain the written permission of your faculty committee for any significant
changes from the Prospectus before effecting such changes. If in doubt as to whether
the changes are significant, consult your primary advisor or the Registrar. Further
details can be found in the BSS Preparation and Submission Checklist on the
Registrar’s website- http://www.cornellcollege.edu/registrar/pdf/bss-form.pdf.
8. In the fall of the student's senior year, the Registrar will review each candidate's
B.S.S. program to determine whether the student has registered for the same or
similar courses as are listed on the Chronology of Courses included in the student's
Prospectus. (This review occurs during the senior conference, described in the
Catalogue section on Degree Programs.) A student who has made significant
deviations from the B.S.S. Prospectus without prior written approval of the faculty
committee will not be awarded the B.S.S. degree.

Professional Programs
Degree Programs in Combination with Professional Schools
Students who can obtain admission to a professional school at the end of their junior
year may petition the Academic Standing Committee to permit them to transfer up to
eight course credits from the professional school to complete their Cornell degree.
Admission to the professional school is not guaranteed by Cornell but is subject in all
cases to the university's acceptance of the student. Students normally apply on their own
to the professional school of their choice (subject to the approval of the program by
Cornell's Academic Standing Committee) or they may select one of the programs
described below with which Cornell is formally affiliated. All such programs permit
students to reduce by at least one year the time required to earn their first professional
degree.
Before beginning the professional program, the student must complete 24 course credits
(of which at least 16 must be Block credits earned at Cornell) with a cumulative Cornell
grade point average of 3.0 or higher. Candidates for the B.A. degree must also complete
each of the following prior to matriculation to the professional program: First-year
Program, Distribution Requirements. B.A. candidates must also complete a major. With
departmental approval, B.A. candidates may complete their Cornell major at the
professional school.
Cornell permits students to receive their Cornell degree at the end of their first year in
professional school if they (1) notify the Cornell Registrar by March 1 of their desire to be
graduated at the end of that academic year, and (2) provide the Cornell Registrar by the
Thursday before Commencement with proof that they have successfully completed the
requisite number of transferable credits, satisfied the requirements for their Cornell
major, and are eligible to return to the professional school for the following year. Only
courses graded C or higher are transferable.
Cornell currently has arrangements in these professional fields: environmental
management, forestry, law, medical technology, and dentistry. For specific information
and forms consult the program advisor or the Registrar.

Combined Degrees Program in Forestry and Environmental
Management
Cornell students in this Three-Two Program earn a Bachelor’s degree from Cornell
College and a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in
either Forestry (M.F.) or Environmental Management (M.E.M.) after completing three
years of study at Cornell and a minimum of two years of graduate work at Duke.
Students should select a major in the natural or social sciences, economics and business,
or environmental studies, and include courses in botany, calculus, statistics, and
economics. Candidates for this program must also satisfy the requirements set forth
above under "Degree Programs in Combination with Professional Schools."
The Master of Forestry degree program concentrates on forest and associated resources,
including woodlands, water, wildlife, and recreation, and their management from an
ecological and economic point of view. Graduates are qualified for employment as
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

22

professional foresters with government agencies, forest industries, and other
organizations.
The Master of Environmental Management degree program considers natural resources
in a broader context. The basic objective of this degree is to develop expertise in planning
and administering the management of the natural environment for maximum human
benefit with minimum deterioration of ecosystem stability. Concentrations include
resource ecology, ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry, water and air resources,
and resource economics and policy. Program Advisor: S. Andy McCollum

Cooperative Program in Medical Technology
In cooperation with the St. Luke's Methodist Hospital School of Medical Laboratory
Science in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Cornell offers a four-year program leading to a bachelor’s
degree and to registration as a medical laboratory scientist/medical technologist. The
first three years of this program are taken in residence at Cornell College, where
candidates must complete 24 course credits with a minimum cumulative 2.5 grade point
average in all science courses and a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or higher. The
minimum requirements for admission to the program are BIO 141 (Foundations:
Cellular Biology), 142 (Foundations: Organismal Biology), 205 (Cell and Molecular
Biology), 315 (Genetics), 326 (Microbiology), and 329 or 330 (Human Anatomy and
Physiology I or II); CHE 121 and 122 (Chemical Principles I and II), 202 (Analytical
Chemistry) and 225 (Organic Chemistry I); and MAT 110 (Great Mathematical Ideas) or
STA 201 (Statistical Methods I). The fourth year is a full calendar year (12 months) and is
spent at St. Luke's Hospital under the supervision of the staff pathologist. Admission to
the St. Luke's program is not automatic but is competitive and based upon grade point
average, the recommendation of the program advisor, and the approval of the
Admissions Committee of St. Luke's.
The St. Luke's Hospital Medical Technology Program is approved by the Registry of
Medical Technologists of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, which is affiliated
with the American Medical Association. Candidates completing the program are
examined by the ASCP for registry and, if approved, may practice in most states in the
United States.
The curriculum in Medical Technology consists of one hour of lecture and seven hours of
practical experience per day in the following laboratory departments: urinalysis,
bacteriology, mycology, virology, parasitology, histology-cytology, chemistry, isotopes,
hematology, coagulation, serology, blood bank, and laboratory management. Upon the
completion of these courses with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher, the candidate
will be granted four course credits in biology, three course credits in chemistry, and one
unassigned credit. Program Advisor: Barbara Christie-Pope

Deferred Admit Program in Dentistry
The University of Iowa College of Dentistry's Deferred Admit Program (DAP) is open to
residents of the state of Iowa. Academically motivated students interested in pursuing a
D.D.S. may be admitted to the DAP as early as the end of the first year of their
undergraduate education.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

23

Although an undergraduate degree is not required for admission, students admitted
through DAP must complete the equivalent number of hours required for a degree at
their institution prior to enrollment in the College of Dentistry. In 2009, nearly 99
percent of the college's first-year dentistry students had a bachelor's degree.
Students selected for the DAP must have and maintain a 3.6 overall grade point average
and a 3.50 science grade point average. You may complete the DAP application any time
after you complete a minimum of two full-time semesters at an accredited four-year
institution. The DAP application deadline is November 1, at least two years prior to your
anticipated enrollment. The Dental Admissions Test (DAT) must be taken by August
prior to the year of your anticipated enrollment in the College of Dentistry, and scores on
each section of the DAT must be at the national average (17) or above. The application
for the DAP is available online at http://grad.admissions.uiowa.edu/academics/ddsdeferred-admit-program-dap.
At Cornell the essential minimum preparation consists of the following courses: BIO 141
and 142 (Foundations: Cellular Biology and Foundations: Organismal Biology), 205 (Cell
and Molecular Biology); CHE 121 and 122 (Chemical Principles I and II) or 161
(Accelerated General Chemistry), 225, 326, and 327 (Organic Chemistry I, II, and
Laboratory) 334 (Biochemistry); either PHY 141, 142, and 263 (Introductory Physics I,
II, and Laboratory) or 161, 162, and 263 (General Physics I, II, and Laboratory); and STA
201 (Statistical Methods I). Other relevant courses are BIO 313 (Developmental Biology),
315 (Genetics), 326 (Microbiology), 327 (Immunology), 328 (Neurobiology), 329 and
330 (Human Anatomy and Physiology I and II). A well-rounded background in the social
sciences; philosophy; psychology; history; foreign languages; business and accounting;
and mathematics is also recommended. Program Advisor: Craig Tepper

Preparation for a Career in a Professional Field
Architecture
Cornell offers a pre-professional advising program to assist students who want to enjoy
the benefits of a liberal arts curriculum while preparing for a specific profession in
architecture. Our students have had success pursuing advanced degrees in architecture
at places such as Washington University, the University of Colorado, Iowa State
University, and Penn State University. Students should complete a series of set courses
and work on preparing a strong portfolio of studio work with an artistic statement.
Although students can choose any major, there is a recommended series of courses that
must be completed in addition to the general education requirements. These
recommendations include: two courses in General Physics (course requires a background
in Calculus), two courses in the history of Western Civilization, six studio art courses
(consider three-dimensional areas such as ceramics or sculpture), and one art history or
history course that addresses architecture as a focus of study from the following: ART
251 (Greek and Hellenistic Art), ART 252 (Etruscan and Roman Art), ART 256 (Italian
Renaissance Art), ART 257 (Medusa’s Gaze), ART 364 (Rome Reborn) and HIS 369
(Chicago).

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

Cornell College has participated in the cooperative program with Washington University
in the past. This program allows a student to complete three years of study here at
Cornell and transfer their fourth undergraduate-year back from Washington University.
Participating in Washington University’s architecture undergraduate track will require
most students to develop their own individualized major. At this point, a student may
matriculate into the March program at Washington University. The cooperative
program route involves 3 years at Cornell and approximately 4 ½ years at Washington
University.
There are exceptions to the list of courses appropriate for pre-architecture that require
consultation with the faculty. Students should contact the program advisor early in their
college career. Advisor: Christina Penn-Goetsch

Education
To prepare for a career as a teacher at the K-12 level, see the statements given under the
Departments of Education, Music, or Kinesiology, and consult with that department
before December 1 of your sophomore year. For a career in higher education, consult the
faculty members in the field of your interest about the proper preparation, about your
choice of graduate school, and about the joys and trials of earning a Ph.D. Notice also
that several departments, under the description of their major, list additional courses to
be taken for students interested in graduate work. Education Advisor: Jill Heinrich

Engineering
Students at Cornell have several options by which to prepare for a career in
engineering. The primary option is to complete a degree in Engineering Sciences at
Cornell. This degree requires 16 course credits, 8 of which are math and science courses
and 8 of which are engineering courses. This degree prepares students for work in
engineering fields and for engineering graduate school. For more information, consult
the Engineering Sciences advisor: Brian Johns.
Another option is for students to earn both a B.A. from Cornell College and a B.S.E. from
a university which offers more specialized engineering degrees. Students may enter the
engineering school after three years at Cornell and then complete requirements for an
engineering degree at the engineering school, which usually requires an additional two
years at the engineering school. To receive the B.A. from Cornell, students must satisfy
all degree requirements at Cornell, including completion of a major. Course and credit
requirements can be satisfied by transferring credits from the engineering school to
Cornell. (See Combined Degrees Program in Engineering.) Some students may prefer to
complete their degree in four years at Cornell and then spend two years at an
engineering school to obtain the Bachelor of Science in Engineering.
Although requirements at engineering schools may vary, the Engineering Sciences major
provides an excellent preparation for the Combined Degree program. Other majors are
possible, and preparation for further work in engineering should include:
MAT 121 (Calculus of a Single Variable), MAT 122 (Calculus of Several Variables), MAT
221 (Linear Algebra), and MAT 236 (Differential Equations); PHY 161, PHY 162,
and PHY 263 (General Physics I, II, and Laboratory); CHE 121 and CHE 122 (Chemical
Principles I and II) or CHE 161 (Accelerated General Chemistry); and
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

25

CSC 140 (Foundations of Computer Science). We also recommend: EGR 131
(Introduction to Engineering Design), EGR 231 (Engineering Mechanics), EGR 271
(Engineering Thermodynamics), and EGR 311 (Engineering Circuits). Those planning to
specialize in chemical engineering should also take CHE 225, CHE 326, and CHE
327 (Organic Chemistry I, II, and Laboratory).
The best option for a particular student depends on the intended field of engineering and
on whether or not the student plans to obtain a professional engineering license. For this
reason, students should consult with the Engineering Sciences advisor or the preengineering advisor during their first year of study at Cornell. Pre-engineering
Advisor: Brian Johns

Law
According to the Law School Admission Council,
A college education should stand on its own merits as preparation for a lifetime of
active involvement in a diverse and changing society. Admission committees are
usually impressed by applicants who can convincingly demonstrate that they've
challenged their thinking and reasoning skills in a diverse course of
undergraduate study. While no single curricular path is the ideal preparation for
law school, you should choose courses that sharpen analytical reasoning and
writing skills. Law schools prefer students who can think, read, and write well,
and who have some understanding of what shapes human experience. You can
acquire these attributes in any number of college courses, whether in humanities,
the social sciences, philosophy, or the natural sciences. It's not so much a matter
of what you study as it is a matter of selecting courses that interest you, challenge
you, and require you to use researching and writing skills. Because a lawyer's
work involves most aspects of our complex society, a broad liberal arts
curriculum is the preferred preparation for law school.
High academic standards are important when selecting your undergraduate
courses. The range of acceptable majors is broad; the quality of the education you
receive is most important. You should acquire skills that enable you to think
critically, reason logically, and speak and write effectively. Undergraduate
programs should reveal your capacity to perform well at an academically rigorous
level. An undergraduate career that is narrow, unchallenging, or vocationallyoriented is not the best preparation for law school.
Additional information about Cornell's Center for Law and Society, Mock Trial, Phi
Alpha Delta and preparation for law school may be found on the Cornell College Law and
Society website.
Consistent with the best advice of law schools themselves, Cornell College has no formal
"pre-law major" and no specific list of recommended courses. Rather we have pre-law
advisors who can help you plan a curriculum to meet your personal needs while
maximizing your chances of admission to law school. If you are considering a legal
career, you should consult regularly with a pre-law advisor about your course of study.

Several departments offer courses specifically concerned with the law and legal issues.
Among them are ECB 255 (Antitrust Policy and Government Regulation); HIS 351 (The
Age of Revolution in America); PHI 353 (Philosophy of Law); POL 122 (Foundations of
the First Amendment), POL 172 (American Politics), POL 325 (Anglo-American
Constitutional Thought), POL 332 (Human Rights), POL 333 (International
Organizations), POL 361 (Race, Sex, and the Constitution), POL 364 (Congress and the
Presidency), POL 365 (Constitutional Law: The American System), POL 366
(Constitutional Law: Rights and Liberties), and POL 561 (Mock Trial); and SOC 248
(Contemporary Native Americans), SOC 348 (Race and Ethnic Relations), and SOC 376
(Civil Rights and Western Racism).
Prospective law students are encouraged to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT)
no later than October of the year preceding their anticipated matriculation in law school.
The LSAT contains sections on reading comprehension, analytical reasoning (structure
of relationships), and logical reasoning (verbal arguments). Application materials and
advice on preparation are available from the pre-law advisors: Craig Allin, M. Philip
Lucas, Genevieve Migely, Mary Olson, and Rob Sutherland.

Medicine
The requirements for admission to medical school (including osteopathy, podiatry, and
veterinary medicine) and the courses which are prerequisites for the Medical College
Admission Test (MCAT) are more or less the same. The MCAT is based upon a core of
work in the sciences which should be completed before attempting the test. Consult the
Dimensions web site located at http://cornellcollege.edu/dimensions/, or consult the
pre-med advisors (Barbara Christie-Pope and Craig Tepper) for further information.
At Cornell the essential minimum preparation consists of the following courses: BIO 141
and 142 (Foundations: Cellular Biology and Foundations: Organismal Biology), BIO 205
(Cell and Molecular Biology); CHE 121 and CHE 122 (Chemical Principles I and II) or
CHE 161 (Accelerated General Chemistry), CHE 225, CHE 326, and CHE 327 (Organic
Chemistry I, II, and Laboratory);STA 201 (Statistical Methods I); and either PHY 141,
PHY 142, and PHY 263 (Introductory Physics I, II, and Laboratory) or PHY 161, PHY
162, and PHY 263 (General Physics I, II, and Laboratory). Other relevant courses are
BIO 211 (Evolution), BIO 313 (Developmental Biology), BIO 315 (Genetics), BIO 326
(Microbiology), BIO 327 (Immunology), BIO 328 (Neurobiology), BIO 329 and BIO 330
(Human Anatomy and Physiology I and II); CHE 334 (Biochemistry); and INT 121
(Communication in Education), found under "Interdepartmental".

Physical Therapy
Cornell offers a pre-professional advising program to assist students who want to enjoy
the benefits of a liberal arts curriculum while preparing for admission to graduate school
in the field of Physical Therapy. After receiving a degree from Cornell, students may
enter a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program. Cornell can help you to be a
competitive candidate and succeed in PT school. The general coursework prerequisites
for physical therapy programs are similar to other pre-health programs with a greater
emphasis in human anatomy and physiology. The GRE (Graduate Record Examination),
as well as clinical experience are both required for acceptance into these
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

27

programs. Many Cornell students interested in physical therapy double major
in Kinesiology and Psychology or Biology and Psychology.
In general, Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs require the following coursework
from Cornell students: BIO 141 and BIO 142 (Foundations: Organismal Biology and
Foundations: Cellular Biology); BIO 329 and BIO 330 (Anatomy and Physiology I & 2);
CHEM 121 and CHEM 122 (Chemical Principals I and Chemical Principals II) or CHEM
161 (Accelerated General Chemistry); STA 201 (statistical Methods I); PHY 141, PHY 142,
PHY 263 (Introductory Physics I & II and Laboratory Physics); PSY 161 (Fundamentals
of Psychological Science) and PSY 318 (Abnormal Psychology). KIN 207 and KIN 309
(Systems Physiology and Anatomy of Human Movement) are strongly
recommended. Some graduate programs may require math and social science courses
not listed above. The Physical Therapy Centralized Application Service (PTCAS) is a
resource for identifying these possible requirements.
Additional information regarding preparation for entrance into a Physical Therapy
program can be found on the Dimensions website or by consulting the Pre-Physical
Therapy advisor, Kristi Meyer, DPT.

Social Work/Human Services
Although graduate programs in Social Work/Human Services generally accept any
major, students preparing for direct entry into these fields should consider majoring in
one or more of the following: Sociology, Psychology, or an individualized major designed
around some particular area (childhood, family, delinquency, etc.).
Students preparing for either graduate training or direct employment should include in
their programs these core courses: ECB 101 (Macroeconomics); PSY 161 (Fundamentals
of Psychological Science); SOC 101 (Sociological Perspectives); POL 172 (American
Politics); and one course in recent American history.
Students are strongly urged to acquire experience in social work or human services as
volunteers or interns. It is possible to earn credit for this kind of experience during the
academic year through PSY or SOC 280/380, and in the summer through PSY or SOC
299/399.

Theology/Ordained Ministry
Most religious groups and denominations require a graduate professional degree from
an accredited seminary or divinity school for entrance into the ordained ministry. The
American Association of Theological Schools encourages prospective candidates to
present a wide variety of courses in humanities, social sciences, language, and natural
sciences which reflects a broad appreciation for the human community. There is no
prescribed pre-theological curriculum, but students moving toward ordained ministry
will find that courses in English, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion, and
Sociology provide solid background for graduate courses related to ministry. Some
students create their own individualized majors combining work in several departments,
capped by an internship. Students considering ordained ministry should contact the
offices of their tradition to secure any special recommendations for their course of study,
and the steps to follow in order to be recognized as a candidate for ordination.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

28

Most seminaries and divinity schools expect that applicants for the Master of Divinity
degree are connected with a specific denomination. It is the candidate's religious
tradition, not a school's affiliation, that confers ordination after completion of the
degree. Therefore, students are encouraged to maintain their religious life while
attending Cornell and may do so by volunteer service in area congregations, campus
religious programs, summer opportunities for service and/or credit internships arranged
by the Chaplain and the Department of Religion. The Chaplain of the College maintains
active relationships with many theological schools and arranges for students to speak
with representatives who come to campus. The Chaplain is available for discussions
concerning the many dimensions of ministry and to assist students seeking admission to
graduate theological schools. The Department of Religion also supports and advises
students preparing for theological education.

ACADEMIC INFORMATION
Absences
Policies on class attendance are the responsibility of individual professors. Faculty are
encouraged, however, to accommodate students who participate in a college-sponsored trip,
encounter an emergency situation (student illness or family death), or participate in religious
observances.
Student Health Services or other health professionals will issue verifications of absence for
sufficient medical reasons. Students who know that they will be absent should notify their
instructors in advance. Those who are unable to do so because of illness or personal or family
crisis should notify their instructors as soon as possible. Instructors will decide on the basis of
their explanations whether or not to accommodate them and in what way.
Students who participate in College-sponsored trips or will be absent due to religious
observances are expected to secure the permission of their course instructors in advance of their
absence and to arrange with their instructors to make up the work they will miss. Students who
fail to make arrangements with their instructors in advance are subject to whatever penalties the
instructors would normally impose for unexcused absences. In case of doubt as to a student's
participation in the trip, the instructor may consult the college sponsor.

Academic Honesty
Cornell College expects all members of the Cornell community to act with academic integrity. An
important aspect of academic integrity is respecting the work of others. A student is expected to
explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others, unless generally known.
When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that the submission is her or
his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no appropriate acknowledgment
of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a violation of the College's requirement
for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty.
The College considers Cornell students to be responsible persons whose maturity will develop in
a community that encourages free inquiry. The College expects the highest degree of personal
integrity in all relationships. Any form of dishonesty is a violation of this spirit and of College
rules.
A student is expected to explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others,
unless generally known. When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that
the submission is her or his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no
appropriate acknowledgement of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a
violation of the College's requirement for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case
of academic dishonesty.
Dishonesty in academic work includes both cheating and plagiarism.
Cheating refers to the use of unauthorized sources of information on examinations or any
attempt by students to deceive the evaluator of an examination, paper, or project.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

30

Plagiarism is the act of taking the work of another and presenting it as one's own, without
acknowledgement of the original source.
There is not one set of rules for the acknowledgement of sources that is appropriate across all
disciplines. For this reason, students are always encouraged to consult their professors and
guidelines included in their syllabi. However, in general the appropriate acknowledgement of
sources involves meeting the following requirements:
Quotations and Paraphrasing
All direct quotations, even if mingled with original words and ideas, must be placed within
quotation marks and accompanied by a specific citation for the source of the quotation. Unless
the information is generally known, all phrases that are not original to the author - even two or
three words - must be placed in quotation marks and cited. If an existing idea is used but
paraphrased or summarized, both the original author's words and sentence structure must be
changed and a specific citation for the source must still be made. It is always the responsibility
of the student to provide precise sources for all ideas, information, or data he or she has
borrowed or adapted. Simply listing sources in a bibliography is not sufficient. Students who use
information from the World Wide Web are expected to follow these same guidelines for the
citation of sources.
Failure to cite sources properly constitutes academic dishonesty, whether the omission is
intentional or not.
Ideas and Data
All students are required to acknowledge the ideas of others. Every student is expected to do her
or his own work in the completion of an assignment or an examination unless either (a) the
sources for these ideas are explicitly cited, or (b) the instructor explicitly allows such
collaboration. In addition, a person giving unauthorized assistance to another on an
examination is just as guilty of cheating as the person who accepts or solicits such aid.
Submitting revisions of academic work previously submitted, either in the current course or in
previous courses, qualifies as academic dishonesty unless the student obtains the explicit
permission of all of the instructors involved.
All data sources must be cited accurately. It is dishonest to fabricate or alter research data
included in laboratory reports, projects, or other assignments.
A safe guide is to provide a full citation for every source consulted. Sources may include, but are
not limited to, published books, articles, reviews, Internet sites, archival material, visual images,
oral presentations, or personal correspondence. In addition, students should always keep
previous drafts of their work in order to provide documentation of their original work. Finally,
due to disciplinary differences, students should consult their professor, a librarian, and/or the
Center for Teaching and Learning for specific instructions on properly providing citations for
sources.
Procedures for Dealing with Dishonesty in Academic Work
If an instructor judges that a student has violated the College's policies on academic honesty, the
student may be charged with academic dishonesty and assigned an F either for the particular
examination, paper, report, or project, or for the course. The instructor shall notify the student
in writing of the charge and the penalty and shall include a statement of the circumstances
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

31

which precipitated the action. A copy of the instructor's letter along with a copy of the paper
shall be sent to the Registrar. The Registrar shall then advise the student in writing of the right
to appeal. Within ten (10) days of notification, the student may appeal the charge and/or the
penalty by submitting a letter to the Dean of the College requesting that he or she appoint an ad
hoc committee consisting of three (3) faculty members, one of whom may be nominated by the
student. The recommendation of this committee is advisory only and is not binding upon the
instructor.
All material and information relative to the charge of academic dishonesty shall be kept by the
Registrar in a special file during the period in which the student is enrolled at Cornell College,
serving only as a statement of record if the student is charged a second time with academic
dishonesty. In the case of an appeal after the first offense, the file shall be destroyed if the
committee finds the student not guilty and the instructor concurs; otherwise, the
recommendation of the committee shall be inserted into the special file. If there are no further
charges, the file will be destroyed at the time of the student's graduation from Cornell.
Should a subsequent charge of academic dishonesty be brought against a student, the Registrar
shall again advise the student in writing of the aforementioned right to appeal under the same
procedures. Should the second charge be sustained by the instructor, the Registrar shall notify
the Dean of the College who shall convene a committee consisting of the Dean of the College, the
Dean of Students, and the Chair of the Academic Standing Committee, who shall determine the
status of the student. The normal penalty for a second offense is indefinite suspension from the
College.

Confidentiality of Student Records
Cornell College, in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as
amended (FERPA), protects the confidentiality of student records and the individual student’s
right to privacy. For more detailed information, see The Compass under the heading
"Confidentiality of Student Records".

Students with Disabilities
Cornell College is committed to compliance with federal law regarding students with disabilities.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states: "No otherwise qualified individual in the
United States, as defined in section 706(7) of this title, shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance..." (29 U.S. Code, paragraph
794).
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 states that a handicap shall be defined as "a physical
or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities." (42 U.S.
Code, paragraph 12102[2]).
The Office of Civil Rights, Department of Education, states that any postsecondary education
program which receives Federal financial assistance "shall make such modifications to its
academic requirements as are necessary to ensure that such requirements do not discriminate
or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified applicant or
student" (34 Code of Federal Regulations, paragraphs 104.41 and 104.44[a]). In addition to
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

32

academic adjustments, "a recipient ... shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no
handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise
subjected to discrimination ... because of absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills" (34 Code of Federal Regulations, paragraph
104.44[d]).
The concept of academic adjustments is not aimed at giving students with disabilities undue
special advantages in order to help them pass, nor does it require that they be graded on a
different scale from their classmates; it requires educational access and opportunity, not a
guarantee of success.
A student qualifies for disability services at Cornell when the student provides current
documentation of the disability from a medical doctor (M.D.), educational or school
psychologist (Ph.D.), or other individual licensed by the state of origin to diagnose learning or
physical disabilities, to the Office of Academic Support and Advising, where it is placed on file as
a confidential record. Cornell College reserves the right to determine what constitutes
appropriate documentation. The student must also request appropriate accommodation from
the instructor of each course within the first three days of each Block.
More information about accommodations for students with learning disabilities is available on
the Cornell web site under "Disability Services."

Academic Advisor
Cornell students and faculty have a long tradition of working closely together both in and out of
the classroom, and this friendly and mutually beneficial association continues to be a vital part
of a Cornell education. When possible, entering students are assigned an academic advisor on
the basis of the interests indicated in the admissions application, but Cornell advisors are
qualified, whatever their teaching disciplines, to assist new students in preparing for any of the
degree programs and majors in the College. Advisors are useful sources of information about
many things, including College regulations and programs, career planning, and adjusting to
Cornell. Students should always feel free to discuss their thoughts and concerns with their
advisors and are expected to inform their advisors as soon as they encounter a problem.
Advisors are able to refer students to administrators or faculty who can provide good advice and
effective assistance, especially when given sufficient time.
Students who wish to change advisors may do so at any time by conferring with the Coordinator
of Academic Support and Advising. Normally students remain with their first advisor until they
declare their degree program and major(s) in their sophomore year. At this time they either
select an advisor in each of their major departments or are assigned major advisors by the
department chairs. If a student has more than one advisor, the student must indicate to the
Registrar which of them is to be her or his principal advisor. The principal advisor is the person
who will register the student, receive all academic information about the student, and endorse
any petitions the student may file.
If for any reason a faculty or staff member ceases to be a student's advisor, the student, in order
to remain enrolled and to receive credit for any work in progress, must secure another advisor
and record the change in the Registrar's Office. Students may not register without the approval
of their academic advisor. The Academic Standing Committee will not consider a petition unless
it is endorsed by the student's academic advisor.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

33

Much of a student's business with the College is conducted in writing by means of forms or
petitions requiring the signatures of faculty and staff members. Any form or petition that is
submitted without the appropriate signatures or that contains a signature that is not genuine
will be deemed invalid and the benefit for which it was proffered will be denied or rescinded. In
this event a student may be asked to leave the College.

Registration
1. A registration or change of registration becomes official upon being recorded by the
Registrar's Office in accordance with the regulations and procedures explained below.
2. Enrolled students register in the spring for all Blocks of the following academic year.
Students admitted at the start of the fall semester with more than 7.0 course credits register
for the entire year before arriving on campus. All other admitted students register for Block
One before arriving on campus, Blocks Two through Four on campus during orientation,
and in October for the remainder of the year. Readmitted students and students admitted
after Block One should consult with the Coordinator of Academic Support and Advising.
After registering, students may drop and add courses as described under "Adding and
Dropping Courses."
3. Registration follows a first-come, first-served process based on number of credits earned.
Students with at least 21 credits register first, followed by students with at least 11 credits,
and finally students with 10.99 or fewer credits register last.
4. Failure to register will be interpreted as a tacit declaration of intent to withdraw from the
College, and the student will become ineligible to return to Cornell for the next academic
year and to qualify for College housing or Cornell financial aid.
5. Full-time degree candidates must register for eight Blocks and must earn at least seven
Block credits every academic year during their first, sophomore, and junior years in order to
remain in good standing. Seniors should register for needed courses and for vacation in the
remainder of the Blocks that semester. Students who enter after Block One must register for
all the Blocks remaining in that academic year in order to be considered as making
satisfactory progress. For an exception to this rule, see "Reduced Programs." This paragraph
does not apply to Continuing Education students.
6. Students must register for off-campus programs, independent studies, and internships in
the same way that they register for regular courses.
7. Occasionally courses are taught over two consecutive Blocks (36 class days) under the
Parallel Format, which permits students to carry two courses concurrently or to take one
Parallel Course along with an independent study. No credit is given for completing only the
first Block of a Parallel Course. The regulations and procedures for registering for Parallel
Courses and for changing such registrations are the same as for single-Block courses with
the exceptions noted under "Adding and Dropping Courses," item 9. It is not possible to
combine a Parallel Course with a single-Block course.
8. Other courses may be taught in an alternate format, e.g., two courses offered concurrently
and as co-requisites or two courses taught consecutively with related topics. Registration
information for these courses will be available at the time of registration.
9. Before registering for and entering any course, the student is responsible for reading the
description of that course in this Catalogue or in its supplements. If there is a prerequisite,
the student must satisfy it before the course begins or must obtain the permission of the
instructor before entering. Instructors have the right to drop a registered student from their
course if he or she has not satisfied the prerequisites.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

34

10. Independent study courses and internships numbered in the 200s and 300s, whether on or
off campus, are open only to students who have completed the required minimum number of
courses in the same department/interdisciplinary major, and for Individual Projects, a
writing-designated course. Off-campus programs numbered in the 900s have special
prerequisites and limits. (See Independent Study Courses and Off-Campus Programs.)
11. Students are not permitted to enroll in or to receive credit for a lower-level course if they
have already passed or been given credit for a course in the same department for which the
lower-level course is an expressed prerequisite, unless written permission is granted by the
department and filed with the Registrar.
12. A student who is registered for a course must be present at all class meetings during the first
three days of the Block or risk being dropped from the class and having her or his place given
to another student. Students who are unable to be present should be in touch with the
instructor in advance to see whether he or she will hold their places. Instructors are not,
however, required to hold places or to admit students at the door.
13. If, at the close of registration, a student is unable to gain admission to a course and the
instructor and department chair are willing to extend the course's enrollment limit (cap), the
student may be admitted to the closed course. Permission will be granted only in cases of
genuine hardship and provided the extension of the cap does not exceed four. The student
must demonstrate that the course is needed to fulfill a degree or major requirement for
which there is no alternative in the same or a different department, and that the course or its
alternative cannot be taken in a different Block or in a later year.
14. Courses are normally capped at 25. Some courses have lower caps. A list of such courses is
available from the Registrar's Office.
15. To aid students in course selection, please see the Courses of Instruction section of this
Catalogue where you will find a complete listing of courses and descriptions by department.
In addition, Cornell College publishes course information online. Information for all staffed
courses can be found on the Registrar’s web page at
http://www.cornellcollege.edu/registrar. Course information for the following academic
year will be posted no later than one week before the first day of spring registration. Course
information and syllabi may be adjusted until the first day of a course, and even during a
course, and as such may differ from the version found online. Students should report any
missing information to the Office of Academic Affairs.

Adjunct Courses
Adjunct courses numbered in the 500s are highly focused mini courses that complement regular
OCAAT offerings and, like Music Lessons, Ensembles, and English or Theatre participation
activities (numbered in the 700s), may be taken along with principal courses.
500-level adjunct courses normally span 2-4 consecutive Blocks and entail a minimum of 2 and
a maximum of 5 hours of work per week (including contact hours) for a total of 25-30 hours to
earn ¼ course credit.
Students may enroll in a maximum of two 500-level adjunct courses (.25 credits each) in any
one semester, and no more than two full credits in 500-level adjunct courses may be counted
toward satisfying the minimum 31 credits required for the B.A. or B.Mus. degree. The College
expects, however, that a student's primary responsibility be to her or his principal courses. The
rules governing registration, grading, and withdrawal are:
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

35

1. Registration in 500-level adjunct courses requires the signature of the instructor and
academic advisor. For 700-level courses, students register directly with the instructor or
ensemble conductor at the beginning of the adjunct course (Blocks One and Five for Music
courses). Admission to some of these courses may be by audition; therefore, interested
students should confer with the instructor or conductor for details before the first meeting of
the course.
2. Students who register, attend for the entire length of the course and satisfactorily complete
the course requirements will receive at the end of the semester a quarter of a credit and a
grade of CR, with the exception of MUS courses in which a letter grade will be assigned.
3. Adjunct courses, music lessons and music ensembles may be repeated for credit every
semester, unless stated otherwise in their course descriptions.
4. Students in courses numbered in the 500s who cease to attend or do not fulfill the course
requirements will automatically be dropped from the course at the end of the semester and
no record of the course will be posted on their transcript. Grades of F, NC, W, WH, and WR
are not assigned for these adjunct courses.
5. Students enrolled in MUS courses numbered in the 700s who cease to attend or who do not
fulfill the course requirements will receive the grade of F unless granted a W or WH.
Students have one month from the start of the lessons or ensemble to drop without any
record of the course or grade being posted on their transcript. (See Department of Music,
"Music Lessons at Cornell" and "Ensemble Participation.")

Auditing Courses
Full-time students who wish to attend a course without receiving academic credit or a grade
may, with the approval of the instructor, audit the course without charge. The student registers
for a vacation Block. The instructor and the student determine at the start the requirements for
attendance and participation, and whether or not the audit is to be recorded on the student's
transcript. If the audit is to be recorded, during the first three days of the Block the student files
with the Registrar the appropriate form signed by the instructor to certify that the student
intends to fulfill the requirements of the audit. At the end of the Block the instructor certifies
that the audit has been fulfilled and the student receives the grade of AU on the transcript. If the
student has not fulfilled the requirements, then the Registrar records a vacation Block. Audited
courses, whether recorded or unrecorded, may not be used to satisfy degree or major
requirements.

Repeating Courses
1. Any course for which a student has received a grade of F or NC may be repeated. In such
cases, the second grade earned in a repeated course does not replace the previous grade of F
or NC and does not erase it from the transcript. Both the first and the second grades will be
calculated when computing the student's grade point average.
2. A student who has passed a course with a low grade may wish to take the course again,
especially if the course is one in a sequence, e.g., CHE 121 or GER 102, where a solid
command of the material in the lower-level course is essential for success in the higher-level
course. The simplest way for students to repeat course material is to retake the course as an
Audit (see "Auditing Courses"). In special cases a student may wish to repeat a course for
credit and grade. Unless the course specifically states in its description that it may be
repeated, e.g., ART 291 or BIO 485, the student must first petition the Academic Standing
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

36

Committee. The original grade earned remains on the transcript and is not replaced by the
subsequent grade, as in [1]. A repeated course does not gain the student an additional course
credit toward graduation, unless the course description indicates that it may be repeated.
3. Adjunct courses, music lessons and music ensembles are exceptions to the above rule and
may be repeated every semester unless it is stated otherwise in their descriptions.
4. Students who have received credit by examination or transfer will lose this credit if they take
a course at Cornell that is the same as or similar to the examination or transferred course. In
general, all introductory courses in the same academic discipline are considered to be
similar even though their titles or actual contents may vary. Students who believe that their
two courses are significantly different should consult the department chair for permission to
receive credit for both.

Two Course Credits in One Block
Students are not permitted to earn credit for more than one full Cornell course or two half
Cornell courses per Block. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Academic Standing
Committee to seniors who can demonstrate that they will have a minimum of 31 course credits
without the credit for which they are petitioning, and will otherwise qualify for graduation at the
end of the academic year. The additional course must be one needed to complete the student's
major or professional program. No more than two Block credits may be earned in this way, and
neither of these credits may be used to make up course deficiencies in order to yield the
minimum 31 course credits required for graduation. Students granted permission to earn two
Cornell course credits in one Block may not take a vacation Block within that academic year.
Should they do so, the second Block credit will be disallowed and the course will not be recorded
on their transcript.

Adding and Dropping Courses
1. After registration but before the beginning of the Block in which the course is taught, a
student may drop that course and add another before 4:00 p.m. on the Friday immediately
preceding that Block. Students are encouraged to discuss course adds/drops with their
academic advisor before making changes to their schedules.
2. During the first three days of the Block in which the course is taught, a student may drop
that course and add another course by (1) obtaining the Drop/Add Form from the Registrar's
Office, (2) securing the signatures of the instructor of the course being dropped, the
instructor of the course being added, and the academic advisor, and (3) returning the form
to the Registrar's Office before 4:00 p.m. of the third day (normally the first Wednesday) of
the Block. Students who drop a course after the first day and cannot add another must
petition for a reduced load. However, this may impact progress toward graduation (see
"Satisfactory Academic Progress"). Instructors are not required to add students after the
course has begun, and permission to add a course is more difficult to obtain after the first
day, so students should not delay in contacting instructors of courses they wish to add.
3. If a student does not attend or ceases to attend a course for which he or she is registered and
does not add another course in its place before the end of the third day of the Block, the
student will be given the grade of WR. Students who receive a grade of WR are charged
tuition for the course, but they are not eligible for institutional financial aid or VA benefits
for that Block. Any federal or state financial aid eligibility will be reviewed on a case by case
basis per federal and state regulations.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

4. Students who attend a course for which they are not registered must petition to request to
add the course late; such permission is not necessarily granted.
5. Students who wish to audit a course must declare their intention to the instructor at the very
beginning of the Block (see "Auditing Courses").
6. Withdrawal between the 4th and 14th day of the Block is possible only when recommended
by the instructor. The instructor may release a student if the instructor believes that the
student, when compared with the others in the class, has not had adequate preparation or is
deficient in a skill essential for success in the course. The instructor must describe the
student's problem in a letter to the Academic Standing Committee and also certify that the
student attended faithfully and tried to do the work assigned. The student receives a grade of
W.
7. On the 15th day of the Block (normally the third Friday) in which the course is taught, a
student may withdraw and receive a grade of W for a course by (1) obtaining the Drop/Add
Form from the Registrar's Office, (2) securing the signatures of the instructor and the
academic advisor, and (3) returning the form to the Registrar's Office before 4:00 p.m. that
day. The instructor should agree to sign the form if and only if the student (a) has complied
fully with the instructor's attendance policy, (b) has taken all the tests and turned in all the
papers or projects that were due by the 15th day, and (c) has made, in the opinion of the
instructor, a determined effort to learn the material, complete the work, and participate in
the class.
8. Students on Probation or Probationary Suspension, however, are not permitted to withdraw
from a course without permission from the Academic Standing Committee. They must file a
petition with their Drop/Add Form on the 15th day, but continue in the course pending the
Committee's decision. The Committee will evaluate the petition not only on the grounds
listed in item 6 above for a particular course, but also on the basis of the student's entire
academic record.
9. A withdrawal for health or family emergency (grade of WH) may be given by the Academic
Standing Committee upon petition, or by the Registrar acting as the Committee's agent,
when a student is ill or has a personal crisis or family emergency, such that completing the
course by taking an Incomplete (see "Grades," item 4) would not be feasible. The student
should submit a petition for a WH. The course instructor and the academic advisor must
sign the petition, acknowledging that they have been notified of the student's intention. Both
the course instructor and academic advisor are encouraged to submit a statement indicating
whether they support the petition or not, and why. For a WH, a signature alone shall not be
interpreted as endorsement of the petition.
a. Any petition based upon medical or psychological conditions must be supported by a
written statement from an appropriate health professional stating the problem; the dates
when the student was examined, treated, or counseled; and the recuperative difficulties,
if any.
b. Students who claim a personal or family emergency may be asked to provide
documentation and to account for the entire time during which they say they were, or
will be, unable to attend classes or to study.
c. Cornell counselors and health professionals will not normally issue a recommendation
for a withdrawal unless the student has consulted them at or near the onset of the
problem.
d. Such recommendations, however, do not automatically constitute grounds for a WH. The
Committee will in all cases consider the instructor's evaluation of the student's work in
the course before the onset of the illness or emergency as well as the circumstances on
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

38

which the student has based her or his petition. The Committee reserves the right to
consult with anyone whom the student offers as a recommender or corroborator.
Students on Probation or Probationary Suspension do have the right to petition for a
WH, and their petitions will be considered in the same way as any other student's.
10. Students may add and drop parallel courses as follows:
a. During the first three days of the first Block, a student may replace parallel courses with
one single-Block course.
b. Between the 15th and 21st days (normally the third Friday and the fifth Wednesday) as in
item 6 above, if the student retains one of the parallel courses, he or she may add in the
second Block of the parallel sequence only a half-credit independent study or a vacation
Block. If the student drops both parallel courses, the student may add one single-term
course in what would have been the second Block of the sequence.
c. On the 33rd day (the 15th day of the second Block) as in item 6.
11. Students who register for a course that requires an additional fee, e.g., a course taught off
campus or one that involves field trips or special provisions, and later decide not to enroll
must notify the instructor and the Registrar before the instructor's final deadline or, if no
such deadline has been announced, then at least 60 days before the course is scheduled to
begin. Students who drop after this deadline are liable for payment of the full cost of the
program. Instructors calculate the cost of a trip, make reservations, and order materials
based on anticipated enrollments. The loss of even one student may result in higher costs for
the other participants or in the College being charged a penalty by hotels, airlines, and
cooperating agencies.

Reduced Programs
Students, other than seniors and those in the Continuing Education Program, who wish to enroll
for fewer than eight Block credits in an academic year must obtain the permission of the
Academic Standing Committee. Permission is usually granted if the student will (1) gain
additional educational or professional experience related to the major or field of concentration,
or (2) resolve physical, psychological, personal, or financial problems that may otherwise
prevent her or him from continuing at Cornell, or (3) had reason to drop a course on day 2 or
day 3 and could not add another, so long as this will not impact a student’s satisfactory academic
progress. The petition must also contain a description of how and where the student plans to
spend the Blocks when he or she will not be taking classes at Cornell. Students on reduced
programs surrender, during those Blocks when they are not taking courses, the privileges of
regularly enrolled students and are, therefore, not necessarily permitted to live in College
housing, to use College facilities, and participation in any Cornell-sponsored extracurricular
activities in ways that are not also open to the general public may be restricted. Students on
reduced programs may not transfer to Cornell any coursework taken at another school during
the regular academic year (September through May). The financial aid of students on reduced
programs will be affected and such students should discuss the implications with the Financial
Assistance Office.

Absence.)

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires that each student maintain satisfactory
progress in the course of study the student is pursuing in order to receive Federal Title IV
financial aid. The concept of satisfactory progress mandates monitoring of both grade point
average and the number of credits completed. In complying with this requirement, Cornell
College has developed standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress cited in this Catalogue
under "Academic Review." Satisfactory academic progress is based on the quality of your
academic performance, which is represented by your GPA, and a quantitative review of
progress, defined as "Pace", which is represented by the total number of credits successfully
completed toward your degree compared to the total credits you have attempted. Students must
meet the following percentages of their attempted credit hours [on a cumulative basis]:
End of Grade Level
Minimum Percentage of Attempted Credits Successfully Completed
First year
62.5%
Sophomore
81.3%
Junior
87.5%
Pace and GPA are prorated for less than full-time students.

Failure to earn credit for courses due to receiving an F, W, WH, WR, NC, I, or IP are included as
attempted hours for determining “Pace” toward graduation for purposes of Satisfactory
Academic Progress [SAP].
The Academic Standing Committee conducts academic reviews of all students and determines a
student’s status based on criteria outlined under “Academic Review.” Some categories of
Academic Review have implications for a student’s eligibility for federal financial aid. At Cornell,
these standards are also applied to state and institutional aid programs.
The Cornell College Satisfactory Academic Progress standards apply to all students who wish to
establish or maintain financial assistance eligibility. It is the responsibility of all students to be
familiar with these standards. The standards apply to each student’s entire academic record at
Cornell, whether or not the student received financial assistance for previous Blocks of
enrollment. All federal and state grants, loans, and work-study, and Cornell College grants, are
subject to the following Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress policy. The college’s
published program length is 31 credits to complete a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Special
Studies or Bachelor of Music degree. The time frame to complete your degree is 150% [46.5
credits]. Cornell College aid is not available beyond eight semesters of full-time attendance.
Specific financial assistance programs may require higher minimum standards for GPA and
pace; additionally, an individual Cornell department may require the student to earn more
credit hours or maintain a higher grade point average than required by minimum standards.
Financial Aid reviews the decisions of the Academic Standing Subcommittee at the end of each
semester to determine if the student should be placed on FINANCIAL AID WARNING,
FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION, or FINANCIAL AID PROBATION.
The following policy and procedures will be followed in determining satisfactory academic
progress for the purpose of establishing eligibility for financial aid.
1. At the end of a semester, a student placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION by the Academic
Standing Subcommittee (or a student continuing on ACADEMIC PROBATION if placed on
that status during the semester) will be placed on FINANCIAL AID WARNING. A student
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

40

placed on FINANCIAL AID WARNING remains eligible for financial aid in the subsequent
semester. The Financial Aid Office will send letters to all students placed on ACADEMIC
PROBATION stating that they have also been placed on FINANCIAL AID WARNING. For
the purpose of this policy PROBATIONARY SUSPENSION is considered a subcategory of
ACADEMIC PROBATION.
2. At the end of the following semester, a student who has been placed on FINANCIAL AID
WARNING at the end of the previous semester (see #1) will be reviewed. If the Academic
Standing Subcommittee
a. removes him/her from ACADEMIC PROBATION, s/he will be removed from
FINANCIAL AID WARNING. The Financial Aid Office will send letters to all students
removed from ACADEMIC PROBATION stating that they have also been removed from
FINANCIAL AID WARNING.
b. continues him/her on ACADEMIC PROBATION, s/he will be placed on FINANCIAL AID
SUSPENSION and will be ineligible to receive financial aid in the following semester.
S/he can file an appeal to be placed on FINANCIAL AID PROBATION by meeting the
following conditions:
i. The Director of Financial Aid will notify the student that s/he is eligible for
FINANCIAL AID PROBATION. The student must then file an appeal with the
Director of Financial Aid appealing the loss of financial aidbefore the start of the next
semester. The appeal must be written, outline the reason[s] for failure to meet the
minimum credit and/or GPA requirements, and explain how the student plans to
correct the problem.
ii. If the appeal is approved, the student must develop or continue with an Academic
Plan/Learning Contract in consultation with the Coordinator of Academic Support
and Advising.
At the end of a third semester, if the student on FINANCIAL AID PROBATION remains on
ACADEMIC PROBATION, the student’s financial aid will be rescinded.
A student whose financial aid has been rescinded as a result of the preceding policies and
procedures reestablishes eligibility when removed from ACADEMIC PROBATION by the
Academic Standing Subcommittee.
A flow chart outlining this process can be found on the Registrar’s website. The chart is a tool;
the official procedure is contained in this policy.
The calculation of GPA for purposes of Academic Review and subsequent determination of
federal financial aid eligibility does not include grades of Incomplete (I), Withdrawal (W),
Withdrawal for Health (WH), Registrar’s Withdrawal (WR), or grades for courses that have been
transferred to Cornell College
Transfer credits, accepted by Cornell, are counted as both attempted and completed hours for
purposes of SAP.
For repeated coursework, the original grade earned remains on the transcript and is not
replaced by the subsequent grade. A repeated course does not gain the student an additional
course credit toward graduation, unless the course description indicates that it may be repeated.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

Veterans Administration
Students receiving VA benefits should consult with the Financial Assistance Office for
information and assistance. VA benefits recipients have the same rights and responsibilities as
all other Cornell students and are subject to the regulations and policies described in this
Catalogue except where the Federal Government has established laws or guidelines that are at
variance with Cornell's rules. In such cases, the VA recipient is held accountable for satisfying
both the College's and the Government's regulations.
Specifically, the points of difference are: (1) VA recipients will not be paid for a vacation Block.
(2) VA recipients will not be paid, or will be billed for overpayment, for any course from which
they withdraw, i.e., receive a grade of W, WH, or WR, unless the VA approves their appeal on
grounds of mitigating circumstances. (3) VA recipients who are placed on Probation by Cornell
College will be given two semesters (eight Blocks) to remove themselves from academic review.
If, at the end of this probationary period, the recipient fails to demonstrate satisfactory progress,
the recipient may have her or his benefits discontinued. The VA will not pay for any course
numbered in the 900s (off-campus programs). Permission may sometimes be granted by the VA
for a non-traditional educational experience upon petition in advance of the start of the project.

Declaration of Degree Candidacy, Majors, and Minors
1. On or before December 1 of their sophomore year, students must make one of the following
declarations in the Registrar's Office (those admitted with senior standing must make their
declarations within the first three months after entering Cornell):
a. declare themselves candidates for either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Music
degree by filing a Declaration of Major card;
b. declare themselves candidates for the Bachelor of Special Studies degree by filing a
Declaration of B.S.S. Degree card, and soon after that a completed Prospectus; or
c. declare themselves unable to make a decision by filing for a Curriculum Advisor.
Students may ask any faculty member to serve as their Curriculum Advisor. Under this
arrangement, the advisor will work with the student to determine her or his academic
and career goals and the best methods for achieving these.
d. Sophomores who neglect to file their declarations on time will be subject to the
regulations governing B.A. candidates and may be denied permission to register for their
junior year. (See Degree Programs.)
2. In all degree tracks, students are limited to some combination of majors and minors totaling
no more than three. Only in the B.S.S. degree can this be a combination of three minors.
Each of the other degrees requires at least one major. Students may not elect both a major
and a minor in the same discipline or interdisciplinary program, though a student may
complete two minors in the same department.
3. Students may choose one or more of the departmental or interdisciplinary majors described
in the central section of this Catalogue (see Courses of Instruction for particular subjects),
or they may design an individualized major.
a. Departmental majors allow a student to study a single discipline in depth. Cornell
currently offers 26 departmental majors: Art History, Studio Art, Biology, Business,
Chemistry, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Computer Science, Economics and
Business, Elementary Education, Engineering Sciences, English, Geology, History,
Kinesiology, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Politics, Psychology, Religion,
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

42

b.

c.

d.

e.

g.

Sociology, and Theatre. (There are also three teaching majors without an accompanying
departmental major. They are Latin, Anthropology, and Theatre.)
Interdisciplinary majors offer the opportunity for a student to specialize in a recognized
academic field by taking courses from various related disciplines. Cornell's current
interdisciplinary majors are: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Classical Studies,
Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies,
International Relations, Latin American Studies, Russian Studies, and Sociology and
Anthropology.
Individualized majors are programs that students design themselves to meet their
particular needs and interests. Such a major involves a minimum of nine course credits
to include four courses at the 300 level or above from at least two disciplines (not
counting the capstone experience); a capstone experience (e.g., a course, individual
project, or internship) at the 300 level or above; and at least six courses at or above the
200 level. A narrative that explains how these courses create a coherent major and
describes how the capstone experience will synthesize the courses into a cohesive
program of study is to be filed with the contract for this major. This type of major is a
contract between the student and a committee of three faculty members chosen by the
student. The contract for an individualized major must be signed by the student, the
members of the committee, and the Registrar, acting for the Dean of the College. Any
changes in the contract must be approved in writing by all members of the committee.
The contract and any changes must be filed with the Registrar. The student must
complete a minimum of 10 course credits after initially filing this form with the
Registrar. For more information, consult the Registrar.
The requirements for departmental, interdisciplinary, and individualized majors are the
same for both B.A. and B.S.S. candidates. A student is officially classified as a major only
after he or she has been approved by the department or committee concerned and has
filed the appropriate declaration with the Registrar.
There is no restriction on adding majors after the sophomore year and no penalty for
dropping them except that all B.A. candidates must complete at least one major and
B.S.S. candidates must complete the basic contract they signed when filing their
Prospectus.
Students are expected to complete the major and minor requirements that were in effect
at the time of Spring registration for their second year of courses. Transfer students who
are admitted with sophomore or higher standing satisfy the requirements in effect when
they begin their first course at Cornell. Students who have withdrawn from Cornell and
are later readmitted follow the requirements in effect at the time of their readmission.
Exceptions may be made by the department concerned in response to the student's
petition, provided that such changes are feasible for and agreeable to the department.
Cornell College alumni who wish to fulfill the requirements for an additional major after
graduation must be accepted by the department (see procedure outlined above) and
complete the necessary courses (there is no minimum number of credits that must be
earned after graduation as long as the major requirements are met). Courses taken at
another institution must be approved by the department in which the major will be
granted. Financial aid may not be available, and students are advised to consult the
Office of Financial Assistance before enrolling. During the last Block of attendance, the
student must meet with the Registrar to confirm that all requirements are completed. At
the conference, the student will request that the additional major be recorded on his or

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

43

her transcript. Upon completion, the additional major along with the date of completion
will be recorded on the student's transcript.
4. A minor is a coherent collection of courses numbering at least five, with at least two of them
being at the 200-level or above. Cornell currently offers minors in American Politics &
Public Policy, Anthropology, Applied Mathematics, Art History, Biology, Business,
Chemistry, Civic Engagement, Classical Studies, Computer Science, English, Environmental
Studies, French, Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies, Geology, German Studies,
History, International Relations & Comparative Government, Kinesiology, Latin American
Studies, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Thought, Psychology, Religion,
Russian, Sociology, Spanish, Studio Art, and Theatre.
5. When there is an overlap between courses required or accepted for a major in one
department or program and a minor in another, at least two courses must be completed
beyond the courses counted toward the major in order to earn the minor in the other
department or program.
6. Some departments also offer suggestions under the heading "Concentration" for students
who may not wish or have time to complete the faculty-approved major but who are
interested in a particular area or career relevant to the departmental discipline. Unlike
majors and minors, concentrations are informal combinations of courses and are not
recognized officially by the College. Candidates for the B.S.S. degree who do not choose to
have an official major may call their individually designed program of specialization a
concentration.

Assessment of Student Experiences
An essential aspect of the mission of Cornell College is the evaluation of student experiences,
perceptions, and academic achievement. Each student will be expected to participate in College
and departmental assessment activities such as surveys, focus groups, tests, and personal
interviews. Students will be asked to participate beginning with matriculation and continuing
through graduation. Student involvement in these assessment activities will assist Cornell in
providing current and future students with high-quality, satisfying experiences in keeping with
the mission of the College.

Student Classification and Class Rank
1. All degree candidates are promoted at the end of each academic year according to the
following scale:
Number of Course Credits Earned
Class Standing
0 – 6.75
First Year
7 – 13.75
Sophomore
14 – 22.75
Junior
23 Senior
2. At the end of each semester, the Registrar's Office ranks students within their class
according to their cumulative grade point average, e.g., a senior ranked "10/200" would be
the 10th highest in a class of 200 seniors. A student's class rank is available upon request.
Students who are graduated with fewer than 16 credits earned in courses taken for grade
point credit at Cornell will not be ranked. Also, students who participate in Commencement
and later graduate will not be ranked.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

44

The student's final cumulative grade point average and class ranking (if applicable) is
determined at graduation and will not be affected by any grades subsequently earned should the
student return to Cornell.

Credit by Transfer
Cornell College accepts transfer credit for work completed by a student at an accredited
institution or program. The following guidelines are used in the transfer and awarding of
academic credit:

Institutions and Transcripts
Transfer credit must come from a regionally accredited, degree-granting college or
university (including community colleges) or an international university of comparable
accreditation. The Registrar is responsible for evaluating all transfer credit completed
prior to matriculation at Cornell.
•

•

•

The credit must be documented on an official college transcript sent directly from the
credit-granting institution to the Registrar at Cornell College. Course
descriptions/syllabi for each course may also be requested.
Transfer credit is always evaluated on a course by course basis, unless the
transferring institution has entered into an articulation agreement with Cornell
College.
Courses taken while a student is still enrolled in secondary school (e.g., dual
enrollment) must meet the guidelines outlined in this policy.

Credits
•
•
•

4 semester hours (s.h.) or 6 quarter hours (q.h.) equal 1 Cornell credit.
Only transfer courses of 3 or more s.h. or 4 or more q.h. may be used to satisfy a
major or general education requirement for the B.A. or B.Mus. degree.
The following caps are placed on transfer credits:
Credit Type

Maximum Number of Credits
Cornell
Accepted
Equivalent
Community college
64 semester hours or 96 quarter
16 course credits
hours
Dual enrollment*
24 semester hours or 36 quarter
6 course credits
hours
* Includes Post-Secondary Educational Opportunity (PSEO) credits.

Grades
•
•

A letter grade of “C” or higher is required to earn transfer credit. Grades of “C-” and
below will not earn transfer credit.
Grades do not transfer to Cornell College and are not used in the calculation of a
student’s Cornell grade point average.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

45

Courses
•
•
•
•

Transfer work must be relevant to the curricular program at Cornell College.
To receive specific course credit, transferred courses must be substantially similar to
Cornell College courses.
Transfer courses must be significantly different from previous coursework and must
not regress from previous coursework.
Courses accepted by transfer do not necessarily satisfy the requirements for a major
unless they are approved by the Cornell department concerned. Students should
confer with the chair of their major department to determine whether their
transferred courses may be applied to their major.

Post-Matriculation Transfer Credits
In addition to the above guidelines, the following stipulations apply to students after
they have begun coursework at Cornell:
•

•

•

•

Advance approval for transfer credit is required. Approval must be secured prior to
taking the course via the Petition for Transfer of Credit form available from the
Registrar.
To ensure that work to be completed elsewhere will be accepted as a course (or
credit) counting toward graduation, toward a major, or toward fulfillment of a
general education requirement, students should consult with the relevant academic
department.
Students are permitted to receive credit for courses taken at other institutions during
Cornell’s academic year (September through May) only if they have:
1. junior or senior standing,
2. a grade point average of at least 2.5, and
3. filed a Petition of Transfer Credit form with the registrar prior to enrollment
in the course.
4. A maximum of two of these transfer credits can be counted toward the
minimum 31 course credits required for a Cornell degree.
Students who at the end of their senior year have earned at least 16 course credits at
Cornell may transfer up to 2 course credits (8 s.h. or 12 q.h.) from another institution
to complete their Cornell degree. Seniors with fewer than 16 Cornell course credits
are not permitted to complete their degree by transferring courses. The senior year is
defined as the 8 blocks preceding students’ completion of their final course at Cornell
College. Students are reminded that they must earn 8 of their last 10 credits at
Cornell. (See also General Requirements for Degree Programs, Item 4.)

Exemption, Advanced Placement, and Credit by Examination
In all cases, the final decision as to exemption or advanced placement, with or without credit,
rests with the Cornell departments concerned and the Dean of the College.
Exemption without credit from a prerequisite for any course listed in this Catalogue may be
granted by the instructor.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

46

Exemption without credit from one or more of the general education requirements for the B.A.
or B.Mus. degree is granted by some departments for superior achievement on certain
examinations. (See Bachelor of Arts, Paragraph 6.)
Credits granted to new students from examinations cannot be counted towards the total credits
needed to exempt a student from a First Year Seminar. Even if a student has more than 7
credits from examinations, they must still take a First Year Seminar.
Cornell accepts the following examinations. The exemption, placement, or credit involved must
be requested by the end of the student's eighth Block at Cornell.
1. Cornell College accepts scores of 3 or higher from most of the College Entrance Examination
Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations. The exemption and/or credit awarded for
various exams and scores can be found on the Registrar’s website.
2. The Oxford and Cambridge A-Level Examinations or their equivalents. One or two course
credits, depending upon whether the exemption is for one or two courses, are granted for
scores of 3 or higher.
3. The International Baccalaureate. Two course credits are granted for each score of 5 or above
on a Higher Level examination, and one course credit for each score of 5 or above on a
Standard Level examination, for a maximum of nine course credits. The exemption and/or
credit awarded for various exams and scores can be found on the Registrar’s website.
4. Examinations prepared and administered by Cornell departments at their option are an
additional means of earning credit or exemption, subject to the following conditions:
a. Exemption or credit by examination may be given only for courses listed in this
Catalogue.
b. Credit by examination may not be given for any independent study, internship, group or
individual project, tutorial, seminar, special topic, or research course.
c. A student who audits a Cornell course or who is tutored by a Cornell faculty member is
not eligible to receive credit by examination for such work. A Cornell independent study
course (see Courses 290/390 and b. above) is the appropriate vehicle for such work.
d. Credit by examination is an option offered to students who have mastered Cornell's
course material through study by themselves, in high school or elsewhere (but not for a
course for which the student also receives transfer credit), or through some life
experience.
e. Students desiring credit by examination must first receive permission from the
department concerned. A student may receive credit by examination for a maximum of
seven courses (no more than two such credits may be in any one department). The
examinations must be completed by the end of the student's eighth Block at Cornell.
f. Credit will not be granted twice for passing two relatively similar topics. Students who
believe that the two are significantly different should consult the department chair for
permission to receive credit for both. If granted, the chair(s) must notify the Registrar in
writing.
Credit by examination granted by another institution will not automatically transfer to Cornell;
but where the examination is one that is used by Cornell, credit will be given if the student's
performance meets Cornell's standards.
A student who receives credit for a course by examination and repeats that course at Cornell will
have the examination credit subtracted. Also, students are not eligible to receive credit by
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

47

examination for a lower-level course after they have completed or begun a course for which the
other is a prerequisite.

Grades
1. Passing grades are A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, P, S, and CR. Failure is denoted by
F, NC, and U.
2. W, WH, or WR are recorded when a student withdraws from a course (see "Adding and
Dropping Courses").
3. P indicates satisfactory performance and is given to indicate completion (complete or
partial) of fine arts participation activities that carry no course credits, e.g., MUS 701 (Music
Performance Seminar).
4. The notation I is given only for work of satisfactory quality that is incomplete because of
illness or emergency (supported in the same way as requests for withdrawals for reasons of
health; see "Adding and Dropping Courses," paragraph 8). Permission to receive an
Incomplete in any course for any reason must be secured from the Registrar before the
instructor may record it on the final grade sheet. The petition for requesting an Incomplete
is available from the Registrar's Office. Students are required to indicate the length of time
they and their instructor need to complete the course. The Registrar will normally approve
any reasonable contract. An Incomplete which has not been removed by the end of the
period specified in the contract will automatically be converted to an F if the student is still
enrolled or will remain an I if the student has withdrawn from Cornell.
5. AU indicates a course audited for no credit (see above, "Auditing Courses").
6. IP indicates a course in progress or one for which a final grade has not been submitted by
the instructor.
7. Only courses taken for grade point credit at Cornell College, exclusive of those graded CR, S,
P, I, IP, AU, NC, W, WH, and WR, are used to compute the student's cumulative grade point
average. For the student's convenience, this average is printed on the unofficial transcript
available online. Grade points are assigned according to the following scale:
A

= 4.0000

B

= 3.0000

C

= 2.0000

D = 1.0000

A- = 3.7000

B- = 2.7000

C- = 1.7000

D- = 0.7000

B+ = 3.3000

C+ = 2.3000

D+ = 1.3000

F

= 0.0000

8. Cornell offers a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) option to encourage students to explore
new academic disciplines, but departments and interdepartmental programs are permitted
to exclude specific courses from the S/U option by so stating in the course description.
The S/U option is available to students who have completed a minimum of eight credits
and must be declared when registering for a course or within the first three days of the
course. On the 15th day of the Block (normally the third Friday), the student may rescind the
declaration; if the S/U option is rescinded, the student will receive a grade for the course. No
more than two full S/U credits may be counted toward satisfying the 31 credits required for
graduation.
To exercise this option, students must complete the S/U Form available at the Registrar’s
office or on the Registrar’s office website and return the form to the Registrar’s Office before
the end of the third day of the block. When this option has been selected, grades of C or
above become Satisfactory (S), and grades of C- or below become Unsatisfactory (U). A

satisfactory performance ensures credit toward graduation but does not affect grade-point
averages. An unsatisfactory performance does not confer credit, nor does it affect the gradepoint average. For students who have selected the S/U option, instructors will submit grades
and the Registrar changes the grade appropriately.
The cumulative grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of grade
points earned by the total number of courses taken for grade point credit (including courses
graded F). The cumulative grade point average is calculated to four decimal places and is not
rounded. The student's final cumulative grade point average is determined at graduation,
and will not be affected by grades subsequently earned, should the student return to Cornell.
Certain courses of the type listed below are graded either as Credit (CR) if the instructor
certifies that the student has done work of "C" quality or better, or as No Credit (NC) if the
student fails to achieve the minimum standard. All work transferred from other institutions,
all credits earned by examinations or advanced placement, all courses numbered in the
900s, and certain other courses identified in this Catalogue by the notation (CR) at the end
of their description are automatically recorded as Credit/No Credit. A few courses offer the
student, with the approval of the instructor, the choice of a regular grade or Credit/No
Credit, and these are marked with (OP) at the end of their description.
The grades earned in off-campus courses numbered in the 900s are recorded on the
student's transcript as CR/NC, but are never computed into the student's Cornell grade point
average.
Grades are reported by the Registrar to the student and the academic advisor. At the end of
each Block, the student's grade report is available on-line.
Students may authorize access to their grades to their parent(s)/guardian through the
Student Shared Information page (http://www.cornellcollege.edu/informationtechnology/training/self-service-registration/self-service/sharing-grades.shtml?). In order
for a parent to see anything, the student must log into the system and set the parent up to
have access. Authorizing access to grades in the self-service system does not change a
students’ FERPA status. (See “Confidentiality of Student Records.”)
Students who believe that there is an error in the information reported on their grade report
or that an injustice has been done them in the grading process should consult the Registrar
immediately. After a lapse of one Block from the issuance of the report, the information
becomes a permanent part of the student's official transcript. A student who disputes a final
grade should appeal first to the instructor. If not satisfied, the student should consult the
department chair and then, if need be, the Dean of the College. Although the department
chair and the Dean may act as mediators, the decision of the instructor is final.
For an instructor to change a grade, the instructor must submit a request to the Academic
Standing Committee and explain the circumstances prompting the change, e.g., that he or
she miscalculated or has re-evaluated the student's academic performance up through the
close of the Block. After a lapse of one Block from the issuance of the grade report, the
information becomes a permanent part of the student's official transcript. The Committee
does not permit an instructor to change a final grade because of work submitted or revised
after the instructor reported the original final grade to the Registrar.
An instructor must report final grades to the Registrar by noon on the Monday following the
close of the Block in which the course was taught, with the following exceptions: Block 4
grades are due the Monday before the start of Block 5, and Block 6 grades are due the first
Monday of Block 7. Although a Block technically ends at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th day of the
course (normally a Wednesday), an instructor may, but is not required to, grant a student an
extension of one or more days. In such cases, students are responsible for turning in their

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

49

work early enough to allow the instructor to grade it and submit the grade to the Registrar by
the Monday noon deadline. If the assignments are not finished and graded by this deadline,
the instructor must issue a final grade based upon the work that the student has actually
completed. No subsequent change of grade is permitted unless the student has been granted
an Incomplete by the Registrar.
17. Credits and grades are posted on the student's transcript at the end of each Block. Unofficial
transcripts are available on-line to current students. Information regarding ordering official
transcripts is available on the Registrar's Office web site.

The Dean's List
Twice each year – at the end of January and the end of May – the Dean of the College recognizes
those students who have earned superior grades during the previous semester and enrolls them
on the Dean's List based upon their semester grade point average.
Highest Honors
High Honors
Honors

4.0000
3.8000 – 3.9999
3.6000 – 3.7999

To be considered for the Dean's List, students must earn grade point credit in at least four
Blocks during the semester (Blocks One through Four for the first semester, Blocks Five through
Eight for the second semester) and must not earn any grades of F, NC, W, or WR, nor have an
unresolved Incomplete on their record at the time the Dean's List is calculated. Grades earned in
music lessons and ensembles are also calculated (except that the grade in MUS 701 is not
calculated).

Graduation
The College confers degrees in May, August, and at the end of block 4; Commencement
exercises, however, are held only in the spring following Block Eight. All candidates for
graduation are required to attend the Spring Commencement unless granted permission by the
Dean of the College to be graduated in absentia.
Students must file an application for graduation (see "General Requirements for Degree
Programs," Paragraphs 2 and 3). Transcripts of work taken at other schools before September of
a student's senior year and statements of confirmation or exemption requested during the
Senior Conference must be received by the Registrar before December 31 if they are to be
credited toward the student's graduation during that academic year.
Candidates who are not enrolled in the year in which they expect to receive their degree must
notify the Registrar's Office before March 1 of their intention to be graduated. If there are any
transcripts or other kinds of documentation needed to complete their degree requirements, the
Registrar will specify the deadline. Seniors on off-campus programs that do not issue final
grades before Cornell's deadline must necessarily postpone their graduation until August. Even
though a student may complete her or his requirements immediately after Commencement, the
degree will not be conferred, nor the diploma awarded, retroactively.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

50

Participating in Commencement as a Non-Graduate
Students may request to participate in Commencement activities if, at the end of Block 8
of their senior year, they:
1. (a) are within 2 courses of completing their degree requirements, or (b) have only
student teaching and their education seminar remaining;
2. Have earned at least 29 course credits;
3. have a grade point average of 2.0 or higher; and,
4. have paid in full the balance on their Cornell accounts.
In such cases the student receives a blank diploma jacket and is not considered a
graduate. Students will be awarded their diplomas on the degree conferral date
immediately following completion of their degree requirements. Students who
participate in the Commencement exercises as non-graduates may not participate again
when their degree is actually conferred. To apply for permission from the Academic
Standing Committee to participate as a non-graduate and to be graduated in August,
after Block Four, or the following spring, consult the Registrar before March 1.
Students who elect to participate in Commencement as non-graduates do so with the
understanding that they will not be ranked within the graduating class of that or any
other year and may not be eligible for certain honors or for election to honorary societies
that elect members from those seniors scheduled to be graduated in the spring. A
student who believes that he or she may qualify for such honors should postpone
graduation until the following spring and thereby retain her or his eligibility.
Non-graduates who elect to participate in Commencement have 16 months in which to
complete their final requirements, either by returning to Cornell or by transferring the
final credit(s) to Cornell. If the credits are not completed within that time period,
students are considered to be withdrawn and, if they wish to complete their degree at a
later date, must meet the requirements in effect in the Catalogue at that time.

Honors
Students who during their academic career at Cornell have distinguished themselves by
their outstanding scholarship may be eligible for either or both of the following
categories of Commencement Honors:
All-College Honors, based upon a cumulative grade point average for all courses taken
for grade point credit at Cornell College, provided that such courses total 20 or more (16
or more for transfer students), are indicated on the diploma as follows if the student's
average is within the indicated range:
summa cum laude
magna cum laude
cum laude

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

3.9000 - 4.0000
3.7000 - 3.8999
3.5000 - 3.6999

51

Honors in the Major, with the words "with distinction" printed on the diploma, may be
awarded by a major to graduating seniors who have successfully completed (1) a major
with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in all courses taken within that major; (2) a
project or paper judged to be of honors quality by the faculty of the major; and (3) a
public oral examination on the project or paper (reviewed by at least three faculty
representing two different departments and selected by the major advisor in consultation
with the student) or a public exhibition or recital of artistic merit. Each major may
specify further requirements and establish its own procedures for evaluating the project
or paper. Students interested in earning Honors in the Major should confer with their
department or program chair by the beginning of their senior year.

Graduation Rate
Student Consumer Information, including graduation rates, are available on the
Institutional Research and Assessment website .

Transcripts and Verification of Enrollment
The Registrar's Office is responsible for issuing transcripts and verifying the enrollment of
students. Fees and procedures related to ordering official transcripts can be found on the
Registrar's Office web site. Currently enrolled students can print unofficial copies of their
transcript from Self Service under the “Grades” tab at no charge.
The Registrar's Office will verify the enrollment of students for insurance, employment, or other
purposes as requested. In reporting enrollment status to organizations or agencies outside the
College, students enrolled for a minimum of three Block credits (12 semester hours) per
semester will be reported as "full-time." Students enrolled for two Block credits (eight semester
hours) per semester will be reported as "half-time," and students enrolled for fewer than two
Block credits per semester will be reported as "less than half-time." Students can print
enrollment verifications through the Registrar's Office secure web site.

Academic Review: Warning, Probation, and Suspension
The Academic Review Process is intended to help students meet the standards required for
graduation. The Academic Standing Committee regularly reviews the academic record of all
students enrolled in the College. Students are expected (a) to maintain a cumulative grade point
average (GPA) of 2.00 or higher, and (b) to earn one course credit every Block, so that they will
graduate in four years. Students may lose one course credit over their four years and still
graduate at the end of four years. Students are expected to earn at least 7 course credits during
their first year, at least 15 by the end of their sophomore year, and at least 23 by the end of their
junior year. Students must earn 31 credits to graduate. Transfer students and students who
withdraw from Cornell and then re-enter are assigned a class standing (e.g., sophomore) and are
expected to keep up with their class. (See also Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.) When
students fall below or are at risk of falling below GPA expectations or falling behind on course
credits necessary for graduation, they are subject to academic notifications and sanctions.
Students who are in academic difficulty are expected to work with their instructors, their
academic advisors, the Coordinator of Academic Support and Advising, members of the
counseling staff, the Center for Teaching and Learning, the Registrar, other professionals, and
their parents to identify and resolve the problems that are causing their academic difficulties.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

52

Students in academic difficulty should give serious thought to revising their registrations to
include courses in which they have a greater chance of success. Failure to heed these
notifications and to seek appropriate help may lead to continued academic difficulty which may
result in suspension and dismissal.
The gradations of notifications and sanctions issued by the Committee are described below.
These notifications and sanctions are arranged in order of seriousness.

Warning
Academic Warning is an indicator that the student may become liable for a more serious
academic sanction, including Suspension, if grades do not improve or the student does
not earn academic credits. Students on Warning have no restrictions on their right to
take courses and participate in all the activities of the College. However, they need to
monitor their activities to make sure that they do not fall into greater academic difficulty.
A student on Warning may be subject to suspension at the end of a semester for an
extremely poor academic performance (see 2.a.vi). A student on Warning may be
required to draw up, sign, and fulfill a Learning Contract. The Contract will bind the
student to additional conditions in order to continue as a student at Cornell.

Probation
Academic Probation is an indication that, unless improvement in a student’s academic
performance can be demonstrated, that student risks suspension from Cornell. Students
on Probation have no restrictions on their right to take courses and participate in all the
activities of the College. However, they need to bring up their semester or cumulative
GPA to 2.00 and/or make up lost credits as quickly as possible. They may need to curtail
their non-academic activities to make sure that they do not fall into even greater
difficulty. A student on Probation is required to draw up, sign, and fulfill a Learning
Contract. The Contract will bind the student to additional conditions in order to continue
as a student at Cornell.

Suspension and Probationary Suspension
The phrase “subject to suspension” means that the Academic Standing Committee places
students on Suspension or Probationary Suspension at its own discretion. The primary
criterion for determining a student’s probationary status is whether the student has a
reasonable chance to graduate from Cornell if that student continues at Cornell or
whether the student would benefit from time spent away from the College.
Students whose academic record is such that they are subject to Suspension at the end of
a semester are given the opportunity to (a) explain their academic troubles, (b) outline a
plan for improving their academic performance, and (c) discuss their commitment to
following through on this plan. They must submit this information to the Committee
prior to the time the Committee meets to conduct its academic review of students for the
semester. The actions of the Committee are not subject to appeal.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

53

Probationary Suspension
Students who are subject to suspension but who have, prior to the Academic
Standing Committee’s deliberations, presented a plan for improving their academic
performance that the Committee deems compelling, may be placed on Probationary
Suspension. These students continue on Probation but may have additional
restrictions and obligations as specified by the Committee. Students whom the
Committee deems to have violated these additional restrictions and obligations will
be subject to Academic Suspension.
Suspension
An individual who is suspended for unsatisfactory academic performance has their
status as a student revoked and is denied permission to continue to attend classes, to
enroll in subsequent terms, to reside in College housing, to receive Cornell-funded
financial aid, and to participate in Cornell-sponsored extracurricular activities in
ways that are not also open to the general public. The student must leave the campus
within three days after notification unless granted an extension by the Dean of
Students. The individual may apply for readmission to the College once they have
met stipulations laid out in their suspension letter.

Dismissal
Students are academically dismissed if they have been suspended once before in their
career at Cornell, have been readmitted, and are now being suspended for a second time.
Such students are not permitted to apply for readmission to the College.
The Academic Standing Committee reviews students’ records after each Block. The conditions
under which students are liable for a notification or sanction are described below.
1. After each of Blocks 1-3 or 5-7 (see Fig. 1) students are:
a. Given an ACADEMIC WARNING
i.
if their cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 (Note: first-Block students are allowed
one C- before this category applies to them.), or
ii.
if the average GPA of their four most recent courses falls below 1.25.
b. Placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION
i.
if they receive a second grade of F or NC within a semester.
ii.
if their cumulative GPA is below 2.00 and the average GPA of their four most
recent courses falls below 1.25.
2. After each semester, students are:
a. Reviewed for grade performance (see Fig. 2) and
i.
Given an ACADEMIC WARNING if their cumulative GPA is above 2.0, but their
semester GPA is between 1.25 – 1.99.
ii.
Placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION if their cumulative GPA is above 2.0, but
their semester GPA is below 1.25.
iii.
Placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION if their cumulative GPA is below 2.0 and
semester GPA is between 1.25 – 1.99.
iv.
Continued on ACADEMIC PROBATION if their cumulative GPA is below 2.0 and
their semester GPA above 2.0.
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

v.

Subject to SUSPENSION from the College if they have been on ACADEMIC
PROBATION for a semester and their semester GPA is below 2.0.
vi.
Subject to SUSPENSION from the College if their cumulative GPA is below 2.00
and their semester GPA is below 1.25.
b. Reviewed for earned credit (see Fig. 3) and
i.
Given an ACADEMIC WARNING if they will be unlikely to be graduated in four
years (32 Blocks). (See Fig. 4)
ii.
Placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION if they will be unlikely to be graduated in
four and one-half years (36 Blocks). (See Fig. 4)
iii.
Placed on ACADEMIC PROBATION, at the Committee’s discretion, if they have
lost two course credits during that semester (note – the first vacation Block
taken in any academic year is not counted as a lost course credit). Students are
considered to have lost a course credit if they:
(a) take more than one vacation Block per year;
(b) receive a grade of F or NC; or
(c) withdraw from a course with a grade of W or WR. The words
“withdraw” and “withdrawal” refer to those situations in which students
receive a W or WR notation on their transcripts.

Leave of Absence
A non-academic leave may be granted by the Dean of Students because of medical, financial,
personal, family, or other problems that are best treated away from Cornell. A student who takes
an approved non-academic leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn from Cornell and
Cornell's withdrawal policy applies. A non-academic leave of absence is approved if
•
•

the student has made a written request to the Dean of Students; and
the Dean of Students has determined that there is a reasonable expectation the student will
return from the leave, and has granted written approval. Failure to return by the agreed
upon return date will result in the student being officially withdrawn from the College.

Cornell College policy restricts leaves of absence to a maximum of 90 days unless an extension is
granted by the Dean of Students.
During a leave, the student will be considered withdrawn from Cornell, thus, ineligible for Title

IV (federal) financial assistance during that time.
During a leave of absence, the student surrenders the privileges of regularly enrolled students,
and is, therefore, not permitted to live in College housing, use College facilities, or to participate
in any Cornell-sponsored extracurricular activities in ways that are not also open to the general
public.
Conditions for return include the student continuing to fulfill payment arrangements with the
College while on a leave of absence.
The student should consult with his or her insurance carrier regarding potential insurance
claims or medical expenses that may be acquired during a planned leave of absence.
This Leave of Absence policy does not refer to the Federal Title IV definition of a Leave of
Absence, but is a Cornell College policy.
For information on requesting an academic leave of absence for the purpose of participation in
off-campus study programs not affiliated with Cornell (see "Other Off-Campus Study").

Withdrawal from the College
To withdraw from Cornell College, a student must apply to the Dean of Students. Should a
student leave without official permission, he or she will have the grade of F recorded for each
course in progress. Students who have not attended classes for 60 calendar days and have not
filed for a Reduced Program (see Reduced Programs) or a Withdrawal will be dropped from the
College.
Students must vacate residence hall rooms within 48 hours of initiating the withdrawal process
unless permitted otherwise by the Dean of Students.
Students who are recipients of financial aid or who hold Cornell scholarships or campus
employment should, before withdrawing, discuss with the Office of Financial Assistance the
consequences if they later wish to return to Cornell and need aid.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

57

Students who plan to finish an academic year but not return the following fall may not register
for classes, participate in room selection, and must notify the Dean of Students of their intended
withdrawal by the first Wednesday of Block Eight or the student's enrollment deposit will be
forfeited.

Readmission
A student who withdraws voluntarily, who is dropped for non-attendance, or who is suspended
for academic, disciplinary, or financial reasons is not guaranteed readmission. Such persons
may, however, apply for readmission to the Academic Standing Committee by sending their
request to the Registrar at least one month before the start of the Block in which they wish to reenroll. A Cornell student who leaves and is later readmitted returns under the Catalogue in
effect at the time of readmission. In the case of a student who was suspended, the appropriate
conditions, as stated in the letter of suspension, must have been satisfied before the Committee
will act upon the request. Students, regardless of the type of withdrawal or suspension, will be
evaluated for readmission on their academic achievement, good citizenship, and satisfactory
discharging of their financial obligations to the College while at Cornell and subsequently.
A student who has been classified by the College as a "readmitted student" is not eligible to
receive transfer scholarships offered by Cornell. Consult the Office of Financial Assistance with
any questions or concerns.
At the time the student withdraws voluntarily, is dropped for non-attendance, or is suspended
for academic, disciplinary, or financial reasons, the student forfeits any financial assistance that
was previously awarded. This includes any scholarship, grants, loans, or work study the student
may have had.
If the student is readmitted, his/her financial assistance, including previous academic and fine
arts awards, will be reviewed at that time and based upon current academic and financial
information.
Please contact the Financial Assistance Office if you have questions.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
General Information about Courses
Numbering
The first of the three digits which designate the courses of this Catalogue generally
indicates the following level or type of course:
1xx. introductory courses in the discipline;
2xx. intermediate courses in the discipline;
3xx. advanced courses in the discipline. These courses are not generally open to firstyear students;
4xx. courses for seniors and/or departmental majors. Some of these courses are seminar,
research, and thesis courses;
5xx. adjunct courses, almost all for 1/4 course credit;
6xx. Special Studies, open only to B.S.S. degree candidates;
7xx. music performance lessons and ensembles, English, and Theatre participation
activities; and
9xx. Cornell-affiliated off-campus programs.

Punctuation
When one course number is printed next to another, the following marks are used to
indicate their relation to each other:
hyphen-the first course is a prerequisite for admission to the second [MAT 327-328], or
the second to the third [RUS 101-102-103];
semicolon-the first course is designed for first year students and sophomores or nonmajors, the second course for majors or other advanced students in the department
[ART 231; 331].

Credit
Courses carrying one full course credit (the equivalent of four semester or six quarter
hours) have no notation after their titles. Exceptions are indicated: (1/4) one quarter of a
course credit; (1/2) one half of a course credit; (1/2-1) one half or one course credit, as
the student chooses and if the instructor concurs. (See One Course At A Time, item 5.)

Prerequisites
If a prior course or courses must be taken before another course can be taken, that
information is listed after the course description as "Prerequisite(s)." However, a student
who has taken or learned the equivalent of the prerequisite elsewhere may take the
course. Hence the phrase "or equivalent" is not generally used in this Catalogue.
Similarly, since any instructor may with sufficient cause waive the prerequisite(s) for a
course upon request, the phrase "or with permission of the instructor" is not generally
used either. Hence, when the phrase "permission of the instructor" does appear as the
sole prerequisite, it means that permission must be obtained before a student may
register for the course.

Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

59

Finally, for brevity, the phrase "junior standing" is considered to apply here to both
juniors and seniors, and the phrase "sophomore standing" applies to all three upper
classes.

Repeat Policy
Course descriptions specifically indicate whether the course may be repeated for credit.
All courses which do not specify a repeat policy are subject to the rules specified under
the heading "Repeating Courses". See Repeating Courses.

Chronology
Courses that are described on the following pages without a chronological reference are
normally offered every year. The notation "alternate years" indicates that the course is
usually offered every other year. A few courses are "offered every third year." Others are
not offered on a regular basis and are designated as "not offered every year", "offered
upon request", or "offered subject to the availability of faculty".
When planning beyond the current year, students must take into account the fact that
some of their courses may not be offered every year and must therefore schedule such
courses in the years when they are offered. The actual offerings for any academic year are
published the preceding spring in the Course Schedule. For the scheduling of courses not
offered annually or not advertised on the Course Schedule, students should consult the
department chair or the instructor.

Abbreviations
The following notations are used: (CR)-a course graded only Credit/No Credit; (OP)-a
course where the student with the consent of the instructor may elect to receive either a
regular grade or Credit/No Credit; however, students who desire a regular grade must
inform the Registrar of this fact before the end of the third day of the term in which the
course is undertaken; (NS)-a course where the student cannot use the
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading option.

Anthropology (ANT)
See Sociology/Anthropology

Archaeology (ARC)
Advisors: Ellen Hoobler
Archaeology is a multi-disciplinary field that emphasizes the interpretation of material remains
in order to understand a culture's history, demographics, religions, economic exchange, political
systems, and social values. Archaeologists can specialize in traditionally scientific areas, such as
floral and faunal remains and forensic archaeology (biology), the chemical composition of
ceramics or preservation of delicate paintings (chemistry), or the petrology and geomorphology
of lithics and the ability to survey and map sites (geology). Archaeologists use computer
software to record and catalog data and to map, and sometimes reconstruct, ancient sites.
Historical archaeologists must be able to read coins, inscriptions, and the preserved writings of a
culture (languages). Finally, archaeologists need to be able to understand human interaction
(anthropology) suggested by the art and artifacts of a culture (art history). In short, to be a good
archaeologist, one needs a broad liberal arts education with emphases in one or more specific
areas.
Students may develop an individualized major in Archaeology by following the
recommendations given below and filing with the Registrar a Contract for an Individualized
Major. See Declaration of Degree Candidacy, Majors, and Minors, item 3c. For students
intending to attend graduate school in Archaeology, it is also highly recommended to have an
additional major or minor in a related discipline (e.g., Anthropology, Art History, Classical
Studies, Geology, History, Religion, or Spanish).
Archaeology faculty members: Rhawn Denniston, John Gruber-Miller, Ellen Hoobler, ,
Christina Penn-Goetsch, Philip Venticinque
Major: A minimum of eleven course credits, at least five of which must be at the 300/400 level,
from the following categories:
1. Core courses: ANT 101 (Cultural Anthropology), 110 (Introduction to Archaeology); two
courses in biology, chemistry, or geology; and language through 205.
2. Courses defined by Time and Place:
Choose option 1 or 2 from each of the following two sections:
a. Time:
i.

Vague (films such as A Bout de souffle and Les Quatre Cent Coups), banlieue cinema (films that
focus on or are made by people living in the housing projects surrounding major French cities),
and films by Ousmane Sembène (a Senegalese author and director considered by some to be the

complement our readings of texts. Some readings are in English to provide background
historical and cultural information, but all primary texts are in French. Prerequisite: FRE 301 or
permission of the instructor. FRE 311 or 312 strongly recommended. Offered every third year.
(Humanities)
331. Enlightenment: Eighteenth Century French Literature
France’s fiercely secular understanding of citizenship can be traced back to the Enlightenment
period which culminated in the violent revolution of 1789. French philosophes such as Voltaire,
Rousseau, Diderot, and Montesquieu, united in their belief in the supreme power of human
reason, waged fierce opposition to the social and political constraints of religious authority that
undergirded the Old Regime and promoted an international republic of letters founded on
freedom of expression and human rights. This course focuses on works by the philosophes with
attention to the limits of French Enlightenment thinking with respect to differences of race and
gender. Alternative voices of important historical actors such as Olympe de Gouges, a feminist
abolitionist, and Toussaint l’Ouverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804, will also
be considered. Prerequisite: FRE 301. FRE311 or FRE 312 is strongly recommended. Offered
every third year. (Humanities)
353. Race and Immigration in French Film
Issues surrounding race and immigration are the focus of much attention in the United States,
and such issues are similarly important topics of discussion in France. However, the French
context of race and immigration varies from its American counterpart, and this means that
related questions are differently defined, constructed, and understood. France's long colonial
history plays no small part in generating and continuing conversations on the matters of race
and immigration, and its policy of assimilation vis à vis immigrants and (formerly) colonized
peoples has frequently resulted in debate, protest, and legislation. We will examine
constructions of race and portrayals of immigration in French-language films primarily from
France. Special attention will be paid to intersections of class and gender with race and
immigration. Readings will be provided to buttress understanding of the historical and social
contexts as well as to contribute to comprehension of some critical race theory. This course also
counts towards the GSS major. Prerequisite: FRE 301 or permission of the instructor. FRE 311
or 312 strongly recommended. Offered every third year. (Humanities)
354. Sporting Identities
What can an examination of sports tell us about national cultures and identities in the Frenchspeaking world? How do sports affect—and how are they affected by—gender, class, and race?
How do sports and sports narratives change over time and how does this influence the meanings
and messages they propagate or are made to carry? Do the same sports mean the same things
for different cultures, or even for different people? Through various literary and cultural texts—
photographs, films, short stories, non-fiction, etc.—we will examine the role of sports and sports
narratives in creating, resisting, shifting, or maintaining elements of cultures and identities.
Students do not need to have any familiarity with sports to take this class, but they do need to
have met the prerequisites for taking upper-level courses in French, as the course will be
conducted in French. Prerequisites: This course also counts towards the GSS major.
Prerequisite: FRE 301 or permission of the instructor. FRE 311 or 312 strongly recommended.

meet with the professor during the fall semester of their junior year to discuss the expectations
and process of the senior capstone research project. Work should be completed as a one-term
independent study course during the student’s senior year, and will culminate in a research
paper in French. If more than one student chooses to complete an independent capstone
research project in the same year, they may work concurrently during the same block in a
workshop model, discussing their work with both the professor and one another. NO S/U
option.

Computer Science (CSC)
Tony deLaubenfels, Ross Sowell (chair), Leon Tabak
The technology of computing has developed with unprecedented speed and offers the prospect
of continued rapid advance. Few technologies have so quickly become so pervasive. Few have so
profoundly changed science, business and industry, and government. Some understanding of
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

98

the potential and limitations of computing is essential to anyone who wishes to understand
modern society.
Design, experiment, and analysis: these skills make the computer scientist part engineer, part
scientist, and part mathematician. The student of computer science learns how to effectively
communicate with teammates and clients to define problems and their solutions. Students learn
how to divide a complex problem into pieces of manageable size, to organize and relate the
pieces of information that describe the problem, and to order the steps of the solution. The study
of computer science serves to increase a student's awareness of the necessity of constructing a
hierarchy of abstractions as a means of building and understanding complex machines, the
designer's need to give balanced consideration to competing goals, e.g., minimizing cost while
maximizing computational speed, and the relationship between software and hardware.
Major: A minimum of 10.25 course credits, including 9.25 in Computer Science; also MAT 120
or 121 (Calculus of a Single Variable). The courses in Computer Science must include CSC 140,
144, 151, 218, 301, 512 (capstone), and at least four other 300-level courses. One of the four
required 300-level courses may be an Internship, Individual Project, or Group Project. The
faculty strongly recommends additional study of mathematics and statistics, to include STA 201
(Statistical Methods I) and MAT 221 (Linear Algebra), for those students who intend to pursue
software engineering careers or continue their study of computer science at the graduate level.
Minor: MAT 120 or 121 (Calculus of a Single Variable) and a minimum of six course credits in
Computer Science which include CSC 140, 144, 151, 218, 301 and at least one other 300-level
course, excluding Internships, Individual Projects, and Group Projects.
131. The Beauty and Joy of Computing
Computing has changed the world in profound ways. It has opened up wonderful new ways for
people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. This course will focus
on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing that have changed the world and consider where it will
go in the future. We will discuss the challenges and implications of computer technology,
including the responsibilities of those who design and use computer systems. Students will learn
a bit about computer programming and a lot about writing at the college level. The lab portion of
the course will introduce students to computer programming using languages and development
tools designed for students with no programming experience.
140. Foundations of Computer Science
This course introduces students to problems that engage the interests of computer scientists and
define the field. The course introduces students to object-oriented design, a principal discipline
that computer scientists use to solve problems. Students learn to divide large problems into
small problems, bundle related data with methods that operate on that data, and incorporate
into new designs elements of previously completed designs. The course emphasizes creative
expression using an abstract notation. Students practice designing, writing, testing, and
presenting programs. Success in the course does not require previous programming experience.
144. Software Architecture
Disciplined design, coding, and testing of substantial programs. Specification of relationships
among components of a program using composition and inheritance. Discernment of a client's
requirements. Evaluation of the communication between a computer program and its human

Ethnic Studies (EST)
Advisor: Marcela Ochoa-Shivapour
The Ethnic Studies Program and the courses that make up its major address questions of ethnic
identity and relations among ethnic groups and is supervised by a faculty committee composed
of the course instructors.
In order to receive Ethnic Studies credit a course must devote a significant portion of its content
to the study of subordinate racial or ethnic groups, where a subordinate group is understood as
one whose members are, or have historically been, disadvantaged and subjected to unequal
treatment by the dominant group in a society, the latter understood as a group whose members
have superior access to or control over a society's economic, political, or social power. Specific
courses may emphasize the cultural practices of one or more racial or ethnic groups or the
interrelationships between subordinate and dominant racial or ethnic groups.

171. Gender, Power, and Identity
This interdisciplinary core course in the program analyzes how notions of race, gender,
sexuality, class, nation, physical ability and other aspects of social location materially influence
people’s lives. To conduct our analysis, we will consider various strands of feminism, divergent
positions among queer theorists, and arguments drawn from other identity based fields (e.g
ethnic studies, American studies, postcolonial studies) in order to survey and compare several
perspectives on gender, race, sexuality, race and class. Placing gender and sexuality at the center
of analysis, we will address some of the basic concepts in Gender, Sexualities and Women’s
Studies. We will also explore questions regarding incorporating other social categories such as
race, ethnicity, class and nationality. Throughout the course we will complete readings, watch
films, and engage in exercises to explore the past, present and potential future understandings
about gender and sexuality, paying close attention to political, cultural, and economic contexts.
180-181. Introductory Topics: Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies
See Topics Courses.
270. Social Justice Perspectives and Practices
Intersectional and interdisciplinary exploration of feminist and other social justice perspectives
and practices relevant to understanding and responding to social oppression. Course
discussions focus on power, privilege, oppression, and implications for social change. Activities
and assignments focus on using social justice remedies or ‘tools,’ such as individual resistance,
policy, advocacy, and social action, and collective struggle to propose solutions to contemporary
problems. Areas studied might include critical race theory and critical race feminism, queer
theory, women of color feminisms, transnational/global feminisms, disability studies, liberation
theory, postcolonial theory, feminist ‘locational’ theories. Specific topics vary by instructor.

154. Making of Modern America
The late nineteenth century ushered in a plethora of momentous changes in the economic,
political, and social spheres of American life that heralded the birth of modern society. Massive
upheavals brought about by revolutions in American industry, transportation systems,
immigration patterns, and urbanization fundamentally altered the very structure of American
society. This course examines the underlying changes that gave rise to a new era in American
history epitomized by the "mass" character of modern life by focusing on mass production, mass
consumption, mass culture, and mass movements (including civil rights and women's rights)
from the mid-nineteenth century through the late 1960s. Not open to seniors without

This course examines Spanish history from the Arab invasion through its “Golden Age.” The two
major themes that this course explores are 1) the shift from a frontier society to a colonial
empire, and 2) the multi-religious, multi-cultural nature of Iberian society during this period.
The course examines the dynamics of violence, competition, and coexistence, between Muslims,
Christians, and Jews, as well as within Muslim and Christian society. How did those dynamics,
and the ideology of Reconquest, shape Spanish society and Spain’s early colonial efforts? How
has this period of Spanish history been remembered and interpreted? (Humanities)

demonstrated by the popularity of historic sites, museums, historical re-enactments, televised
historical documentaries and Hollywood films. Yet, despite its growing audience, the discipline
of history seems to be in a state of crisis. Political debates have engendered a public furor over
how American history is being taught and remembered. This course will examine the often
contentious relationship between popular presentations of the past for the general public and
professional historians' scholarly interpretations and provide an introduction to the growing
field of museum studies. The course may include the "hands-on" experience of a mini-internship
at local historical societies, libraries, and museums and the opportunity for students to create
their own online exhibits on different historical topics. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or
permission of the Instructor. Alternate years. No S/U option. (Humanities)
241. Slavery and the Environment in a Comparative Context (in the Bahamas)
This course offers a rare opportunity to explore historic slave plantation ruins on a remote
island in the Bahamas as a means of interpreting the history of slavery. We will examine the
attempt by British Loyalists, who left the American colonies after the Revolutionary War, to
establish cotton production in the Bahamas, using slave labor, and how the environmental
context led to significant differences in the evolving relationships between enslaved people and
plantation owners. A significant portion of the course (two weeks) will be conducted at the
Gerace Research Centre, College of the Bahamas on the island of San Salvador; this will enable
us to explore the ruins of several slave plantations, including the Farquharson Plantation. The
journal Charles Farquharson kept from 1831-1832, which includes a slave uprising, is the only
one in existence documenting a Bahamian slave plantation, and will be a central course text.
This course is cross-listed with Environmental Studies. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor.

d. an elective of any MUS course numbered 200 and above, not to include MUS 212 or any
700 numbered course other than 702 (Composition).
2. Passing the Piano Proficiency Requirement (see below);
3. Passing the Aural Skills Proficiency Requirement (see below);
4. Completion of a senior capstone experience;
5. All Music majors must enroll in a Solo Performance course (music lesson) and in a music
ensemble during their final three semesters, unless excused by the Music Department; and
6. Receive a passing grade (P) in MUS 701 for a minimum of five semesters (see "Music
Performance Seminar").
All senior Music majors must complete a senior capstone experience. There are two categories
from which to choose: recital (MUS 798 or 799); or paper/project (MUS 485). Students may
choose both of these options if they wish. Students who plan to complete MUS 485 as their
capstone must submit a description of the proposed project for departmental approval by
October 1 of their senior year. Student teaching fulfills this requirement for music education
majors.
Minor: A minimum of six course credits in Music which include MUS 110, 210, 310, and at least
three additional courses in Music at the 200 level or above, selected in consultation with and
approved by the Department, not to include MUS 212, 301, or any 700 numbered course.
Music Lessons at Cornell: Students register for Solo Performance courses (music lessons) at
the beginning of Term One and Term Five. These courses are taught over four consecutive
terms. Registration entails additional costs (see Music Lessons, Fees*). Students may withdraw
from these courses only during the first of the four terms. If a student withdraws from a Solo
Performance course during the drop period, he or she will be charged only for the lessons
scheduled between the beginning of the course and the date when the course is officially
dropped and no entry concerning the course will appear on the student's transcript. After the
drop period has passed, if a student ceases to attend, a grade of F will appear on the student's
transcript and the student will be billed for the full semester charge. All music scholarship
students must be enrolled in music lessons to retain their scholarships. For students graduating
before 2017: after a student has earned more than one course credit in the continuing study of
the same instrument, he or she may count the additional credits toward the fulfillment of the
general B.A. requirement for a minimum of eight courses numbered in the 300s or 400s.
Music Lessons, Fees (Solo Performance Courses)*
Music Majors: $200 for one half-hour lesson per week for four terms (one-quarter course
credit); $300 for one hour-long lesson per week for four terms (one-half course credit). These
fees are the same for lessons on secondary instruments. Piano lessons leading toward the
passing of the piano proficiency exam are $100 for one half-hour lesson per week for four terms
(one-quarter course credit).
Non-Music Majors: $350 for one half-hour lesson per week for four terms (one-quarter course
credit). The fee is the same for lessons on secondary instruments.
Recipients of Music Scholarships and Awards will not be charged for lessons on their principal
(scholarship audition) instrument.
Piano Proficiency Requirement: All Music majors, regardless of degree or program, must
pass the Piano Proficiency Requirement by the end of the sophomore year. If this requirement is
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

159

not passed by this time, the student must take applied piano (MUS 761 or 762) until the
requirement has been passed. The requirement consists of six components: performance of
three prepared works; scales; arpeggios; sight reading; and melody harmonization. Also, as part
of the requirement, Music Education majors must demonstrate their ability to perform an
accompaniment with a singer or instrumentalist. A student may pass the requirement in
segments.
Aural Skills Proficiency Requirement:
All BA and BM Music majors must pass the Aural Skills Proficiency Requirement in order to
complete the Music Major. These students must pass each of a series of graduated exams (3
levels required for the BA; 4 levels required for the BM) that test in the following Aural Skills
areas: intervals, chords, scales, melodic dictation, harmonic dictation, and sight singing. These
topics will be taught both within the four required Music Theory courses, as well as in a longerterm self-paced, computer-program-assisted, proficiency-based mode.
Ensemble Participation: Participation in large music ensembles (MUS 712, 713, 715, 716, and
717) is required of all Music majors and music scholarship students, regardless of degree or
program. Requirements vary, depending on the degree program. The student must perform
within an ensemble on his/her primary instrument unless otherwise approved by the
Department of Music. Pianists must complete one full-credit from the large ensembles (712, 713,
714, 715, 716) before they may count MUS 719 or MUS 711 as their primary ensemble credit.
Only pianists may use 719 or 711 to fulfill an ensemble requirement. Regulations governing
adding and dropping ensembles are the same as for Music Lessons, with the exception of MUS
718.
Music Performance Seminar: The Music Performance Seminar (MUS 701) is a semesterlong program that consists of attendance at music events. The purpose of this Seminar is to help
nurture an understanding of diverse musical styles and musical ensembles and to provide
opportunities for student performances. Attendance at concerts, recitals, and Friday afternoon
Music Performance Seminar Student Recitals is required of all Music majors and minors, as well
as all other students who are enrolled in music lessons. (Students who have accepted a Music
Scholarship must satisfy, at minimum, the recital attendance requirement for a Music minor.)
The number of required events changes from semester to semester. Students should contact the
Department of Music each semester for details. Music majors must receive a passing grade in
Music Performance Seminar (MUS 701) in a minimum of five semesters in order to complete the
major. Failure to meet the attendance requirement will result in the student's receiving an F for
Music Performance Seminar. No course credit is given for this Seminar. It is offered on a
Pass/Fail basis.

Philosophy (PHI)
Paul Gray, Genevieve Migely (chair), Jim White
Essential to a liberal education is the ability to think, to detect bad arguments and evidence, to
see more than one side of a matter and to decide which is best, to construct a coherent case, and
to make words perform their tasks with clarity and precision. These principles, along with a
concern for representing the principal areas of philosophical inquiry, and an emphasis on the
careful, creative, and critical reading of important philosophical texts, guide the Department in
planning its curriculum.
Major: A minimum of nine course credits, which include PHI 111 and 202; either 203 or 204;
two courses selected from 302, 304, 305, 306, and 308; PHI 485; and three additional courses

105. Topics in Philosophy
109. Ethics and Climate Change (FYS)
The threat of climate change raises urgent questions about what we ought to do—i.e., questions
about morality. We will spend some time considering climate science and questions raised by
controversy about that science. What should we believe about the claim that human activity is
threatening the climatic stability of our planet given apparent disagreement about the truth of
that hypothesis. We will also spend time considering the moral challenges the risk of climate
change generates: what is the nature of our obligations to prevent harm to people distant in
space and in time; what responsibilities do nations of the industrialized world have to respond
to threats generated by climate change; what does it make sense for such nations to do given the
uncertainty of some outcomes of climate change; what should we, as individual citizens of such
nations, be doing? We will read material of all sorts about these questions—we’ll look at
scientific reports, economic analyses, and philosophical/ethical arguments, for example—and
talk and write about what we make of the issues. Seminar for first year students only. (First Year
Seminar)

General
111. Introduction to Politics
Although you may not realize it, every one of us is involved in politics on a daily basis. We each
have experienced parents and children haggling over the rules governing curfew or use of the
car, employees and bosses negotiating behaviors at work, and organized crime families
disputing turf wars (ok, maybe not that last one). Yet, in one way or another, politics is a part of
our lives regardless of whether we are interested in Congress, political parties, or international
negotiations. Politics is the process by which individuals and groups reach agreements on a
course of joint action--even if they disagree on the intended goals of that action. This class
discusses the problems that groups need to overcome to reach agreements on a joint course of
action, and looks at the political institutions and other political processes and incentives that
enable groups to overcome those barriers here in the United States and internationally. (Social
Science)
216. Education Policy and Practice
This course will explore education policies and their relationship to sociological patterns of
school resegregation, the rise of credentialism, the end of educational expansion, and inequality
of educational opportunity. Students in the course will be introduced to the history of
policymaking in education beginning with the education reform policies of Horace Mann.
Students will also examine demographic data on educational attainment, analyze the policies
that alleviate or reinforce educational inequality, and describe what assumptions lie behind
current reform ideas. We will evaluate the dynamics of current debates by referencing the longstanding tensions among the different purposes of schooling we have in our nation. Same course

common good, often at the expense of individual interests. Addresses how the law resolves
disputes, how it maximizes welfare and wealth, how it is structured, who decides what we mean
by law and how it functions, who decides what the societal interest is and whether it trumps
what an individual wishes to do. (Social Science)

and money (such as comparative advantage, factor and sector models, partial and general
equilibrium, the Heckscher-Ohlin model, imperfect competition, import-substitution vs. exportorientation, strategic trade theory, balance of payments, aggregate demand, the StolperSamuelson theorem, and other concepts, methods, and theorems) to sustain an economically
informed discussion of the political constraints upon and political implications of international
exchange of goods and currencies. I have often noted that the class covers a large part of the
same economic material as ECB 223 (International Economics), though we constantly direct our
attention to the questions of what political constraints preclude or modify the outcomes
economists expect and how economic developments favor and constrain the desires of domestic
political actors. The class also has a substantial focus upon the political constraints upon
economic development, that highlights the very important interactions between these economic
and political science concepts in a particular policy area that is often of interest to students.
Thus, the focus of the class is upon questions that are of interest to both economists and political
scientists, and my hope is that our attention to the interaction between economics and politics –
each viewed through the disciplinary lenses best adapted to understanding them – will help my
students understand the value of using multiple disciplinary approaches to approach problems.

Scientific study of behavior. Topics may include learning, development, personality, perception,
physiological bases of behavior, the behavior of individuals in groups, and abnormal behavior.
(Social Science)
243. Psychological Insights into Environmental Problems (FYS)
Human behavior is at the root of almost all environmental problems: We drive gas guzzling cars
(contributing to both global warming and depletion of natural resources), produce tons of
refuse, deplete water resources (build golf courses in the desert). This course explores facets of
psychology that can help explain why we act as we do and how we might change behavior toward
greater sustainability. We review some basic psychological principles as they apply to the
environment: What are the thinking processes that lead some people to accept and others to
reject concepts like global warming? How do people develop their basic value systems, and how
do things like emotions and culture impact this? Even when people want to change their
behaviors, what are the barriers that make change difficult? Course includes an analysis and
application of these principles to a local issue. (First Year Seminar)
244. Human Aggression and Violence (W)
This course will examine recent efforts to integrate explanations of human aggression and
violence across several disciplines. Students will consider the interplay between social learning,

101. Sociological Thinking
Do you wonder why people do the things they do? Why society works as it does? Ever think the
world is “unfair”? Sociologists study people in the world, looking at patterns, at differences, at
inequalities. Thinking sociologically is like “entering a new and unfamiliar society--one in which
things are no longer what they seem.” It creates “culture shock without geographical
displacement.” This course requires us to look at society with a new perspective, to question our
taken-for-granted assumptions, to investigate people's actions, and to explore the organization
of society. It provides a basis for being engaged citizens, thinking about social alternatives, and
imagining possibilities for social justice. Credit may be given for either 101 or 102, but not for
both. Not open to seniors without permission of the instructor. (Social Science)
102. Topics in Sociological Thinking
The course is a version of Sociological Thinking (SOC 101) with a more specific topic focus. See
Topics Courses for current topics and descriptions. Credit may be given for either 101 or 102, but
not for both. Not open to seniors without permission of the instructor. (Social Science)
246. Gender Diversity
This course will focus on diverse gender identities, bodies, and social presentations. Social
practices and pressures of gender will be examined in order to gain insight into the larger
contemporary social meanings of gender. We will explore how individuals interpret and present

ART
ART 274-7. Topic: Islamic Art and Architecture
Introduction to selected monuments of art and architecture of the Islamic world from
the seventh to the sixteenth century, drawing on buildings and works from Asia, the
Middle East and Europe. This course will provide a basic grounding in some of the issues
surrounding art and aesthetics in the Arab world, and give an idea of the diversity of its
visual culture, to give a sense of the plurality and richness of this field. Apart from
paintings, ceramics, and wooden objects, some of the monuments studied will include:
the Ka’ba in Mecca; the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem; the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul,
Turkey; the Alhambra in Granada, Spain; and the Taj Mahal, in Agra, India. No S/U
option. [AH]. (Humanities) HOOBLER
ART 277-8. Topic: Modern Mexican Art
This seminar will explore, through the selection of a limited number of works of art, the
rich artistic traditions of some of the major movements, styles, and artists of Mexico
from 1920-1968. Many of these artists were attempting to define, and even to shape, a
Mexican national identity with the works they made during this period. We will explore
in depth the concept of Mexicanidad and how conceptions of it have shifted over time.
Defining national identity often means to define oneself in opposition to another or
others. For Mexico in the early 20th century, that other was often the United States. Yet
although few remember the period today, during these decades there was a steady
stream of American artists studying, working, and living in Mexico. So we will consider
the idea of Mexican vs. foreign artists, what each contributed and took away from an
exchange of the two. By the end of this class, students will be able to recognize some of
the major works of art (artist, title, and approximate date) from this time period, and be
able to make informed statements even about works of art they have not seen before
from this same context. No S/U option. [AH] (Humanities) HOOBLER

MILDENSTEIN
BIO 109-1. Topics: Diversity - Evolutionary Perspective
What is diversity and why should you care? This course is designed to encourage
students to read, discuss, and think about diversity—from a biological perspective. We
will examine the diversity of life and life histories. Students will learn about diverse
patterns of reproduction (sexual and asexual), gender, and interactions among
predators, prey, and parasites within biological communities -- including human
populations. We will compare patterns from an evolutionary perspective and discuss
implications. (FYS) CONDON
BIO 381-1. Advanced Topic: Population Ecology
Wildlife conservation requires an understanding of biological and ecological processes
influencing wildlife population dynamics, the human processes that directly and
indirectly influence ecological processes, and the mechanisms by which we can achieve
conservation through manipulation of both ecological and human processes. This course
will introduce the population biological and ecological topics relevant to contemporary
wildlife conservation while providing a historical context for the development of current
approaches to wildlife management and conservation. This course is designed to provide
students with a broad overview of specific topics relevant to wildlife conservation and
opportunities to be involved in conservation in practice. Prerequisites: BIO 142. (Will

relationship with their academic advisor. Additionally, students will explore campus
resources and opportunities enabling them to achieve their goals. Intended for nonscience majors; no previous chemistry course required. (FYS) SHANATA

CLASSICAL AND MODERN LANGUAGES
GERMAN
GER 115-6. Topic: Magic, Myths, and Legends (in English)
The popularity of magic has ebbed and flowed over time, but its persistent cultural
valence in almost all cultures and contexts suggests that magic and magicians—alongside
ever-evolving myths and legends—are irresistible tools in our effort to make sense of our
lives and times. Indeed, even as the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, and
modernization each proclaimed at one point the death of magic, myths, and legends
(think of Max Weber's famous theory of the "de-magification of the world"), these
fantastical stories, images, and cultural products (e.g. Magic: The Gathering) have
endured as treasured visions of the world around us. This course will examine magic,
myths, and legends from Germany, whose famously enchanted forests and castles speak
to a culture that is especially imbued with magic. Students will consume magic and tales
in their raw (and multimedia) forms; study scholarly work on their history, meanings,
and inter-workings; and craft their own creative adaptations of magic, myths, and
legends both young and old based on their individual interests and skills. Students will
emerge from this course with a rich understanding of German history, music, literature,
art, and magic culture from the early-modern period to the 21st century. Taught in
English. (Humanities) CARRINGTON
GER 116-3. Topic: Holocaust (in English)
This course will examine the Holocaust from the perspective of social, cultural, and
emotional history. We will seek to understand this genocide—its perpetrators and
victims—in the context of modern German and European history, specifically interwar
Germany and the rise of the Nazis, WWII, and long-standing anti-semitism throughout
Europe. Students will also interpret the eyewitness accounts and survivor memoirs that
were produced in the wake of such evil and wrestle with some of the Holocaust's most
central and vexing questions: why did the Jews stay? Who was complicit? What did it
mean to be a bystander? Where was God? This course will be taught in English and is
designed for students of all backgrounds. (Humanities) CARRINGTON

SPANISH
SPA 109-1. Topic: The Galaxy Next Door: The Global South in Literature and
Film (FYS)
This class will explore the concept of the “Global South” through literature, film, and
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

211

political and economic analysis. After the Cold War, scholars began referring to a
distinction between the Global North and the Global South in order to replace the
outdated categories of First, Second, and Third World countries. While being an
improvement upon the previous categories, this division tends to overlook the existence
of vast pockets of underdevelopment in the North (the US and Europe), as well as
concentrations of wealth in the South in our current era of globalization. We will focus
our discussions mainly on connections between the US and Latin America while
concentrating on the intersections of immigration, poverty, and constructions of race
and gender. Some of the authors we will read are William Faulkner, Ta-Nehisi Coates,
Junot Diaz, Jamaica Kincaid, and Juan Rulfo. Students will be expected to enroll in an
online learning community and will receive ¼ additional adjunct course credit for their
participation during the fall semester. (FYS) MOSIER
SPA 365-3. Advanced Topic: The Boom and Post-Boom in Latin America
This class analyzes the explosive literary phenomenon of the 60s and 70s known as the
“Boom.” Students will read a selection of works by authors such as Gabriel García
Márquez, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes with an emphasis on magic realism.
Furthermore, we will explore literary trends that follow the Boom generation.
Prerequisite: SPA 311. Offered every third year. (Humanities) MOSIER

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSC 131-1. The Beauty & Joy of Computing (FYS)
Computing has changed the world in profound ways. It has opened up wonderful new
ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. This
course will focus on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing that have changed the world
and consider where it will go in the future. We will discuss the challenges and
implications of computer technology, including the responsibilities of those who design
and use computer systems. Students will learn a bit about computer programming and a
lot about writing at the college level. The lab portion of the course will introduce students
to computer programming using App Inventor, a friendly programming language for
building Android applications. Students will engage in several different types of
academic writing and will conduct their own research projects. Students will be expected
to enroll in an online learning community and will receive ¼ additional adjunct course
credit for their participation during the fall semester. (FYS) SOWELL
CSC 255-5. Topic: Dealing with Data: Data Management, Data Visualization,
and Big Data
Managing and interpreting an overwhelming amount of raw data is part of the
foundation of our information society and economy. People use computers and statistics
to translate, process, and visualize raw data, enabling new understandings that in turn
contribute new knowledge to the world. This course will look at these topics from both a
statistical and a computer science perspective. Statistics will inform the discussion about
what appropriate goals are for learning from the data and how the data will answer the
questions raised. The computer science perspective will help us figure out which goals
are actually feasible computationally, and how to achieve them. Same course as STA 255.

ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
ECB 121-1. Data Visualization (FYS)
Businesses amass data at staggering rates. As a result, they aim to convert information
into valuable insight. Data visualization is the most popular technique for generating
insights. This course introduces methods for representing data for better comprehension
and communication. It introduces students to visual perception and visual design
principles. We will train our eyes to distinguish between effective and ineffective
representations. Working specifically with business and economic data, students will
locate central tendencies, patterns of dispersions, and anomalies. We also explore a
range of graph media contrasting the fit among media, data type and message. Students
will also be introduced to techniques for visualizing concepts or analytical graphing.
Student projects will involve designing information dashboards. (FYS) HEJEEBU
ECB 265- 1. Topic: Introduction to Analytics
The complexity of modern business requires sophisticated tools that help managers
reason through large amounts of data. This course provides an introduction to such
tools. The course will include applications across different areas of a business, such as
operations and market. It will also include applications across different industry sectors,
such as the health care and financial sectors. Prerequisite: STA 201. (Social Science)
MILLER
ECB 266-1. Topic: Health Analytics
This course will explore how analytical methods, along with large data sources, can be
used to solve problems in health care. Students will learn by working through various
real-world cases. Applications covered will include disease surveillance, estimation of
disease outcomes and costs, comparative effectiveness of treatments, health care costs
and insurance pricing, along with health care decision support systems. Prerequisite:
STA 201. MILLER

EDUCATION
EDU 240-3. Education and Culture (W)
This course explores the influence of social issues such as discrimination, diversity,
equity, racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic and socioeconomic pluralism in
American schools. The goals for this class are to understand and be sensitive to the
values, beliefs, lifestyles, and attitudes of individuals and the diverse groups found in a
pluralistic society and to translate knowledge of human relations into attitudes, skills,
and techniques that will support favorable learning experiences. Through critical
analysis, this course reveals ways in which dehumanizing biases may be reflected in
instructional materials, methodologies, media, and everyday encounters and understand
how these interactions may influence classroom dynamics and student learning. No S/U
option. Not open to students who have completed their writing course (W) requirement.

The Life of Bees: an Interdisciplinary Perspective<p>This course will introduce students
to bees and beekeeping through the academic lenses of film studies, food studies, and
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

213

ecology. Bees are responsible for pollinating roughly 1/3 of human foods, and the rise of
Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has raised awareness about their essential importance
to the present-day food economy. The class will consider the ways that bees, and this
crisis, have been represented in literature and film, will investigate the causes of this
crisis, and will propose collective action toward conservation. The course will include
field trips, guest speakers, and a collaboratively cooked meal, in addition to assigned
written work. (FYS) MOUTON
ENG 105- 1. Topic: Can We Be Kind to Strangers? (FYS)
Can we be kind to Strangers? This deceptively simple question implies an equally simple
answer: Yes, of course we can--and we should. Religious texts, folklore, and philosophy
from around the world and from different time periods all encourage us to show
kindness to strangers. But we seldom need stories that exhort us to do what we are
already doing; thus the stories also remind and encourage us to be kind to strangers,
even when we might rather pass by.Thus the question--can we be kind to strangers-gives rise not to a simple answer but to challenging secondary questions. First, Is it in
fact possible to be kind to strangers? Is there a biological basis for helping others? Is
kindness to strangers altruistic or self-interested reciprocity? Next, in today's global,
internet-connected world, what do we mean by stranger? Finally, should we be kind to
strangers? what are the consequences and implications for the recipient and for the
giver? The course will begin with a foundation in the religious and philosophical
foundation for kindness to strangers and will then be organized around different
responses: religious, scientific, and social; individual, societal, and global. Students will
be expected to enroll in an online learning community and will receive ¼ additional
adjunct course credit for their participation during the fall semester. (FYS) REED
ENG 111-2. Topic: The Racial Imaginary (W)
Race is a social construct—an idea we imagine—but it’s an imagined idea so powerful it
shapes our histories, our social systems, and our daily lives. Using Claudia Rankine and
Beth Loffreda’s anthology The Racial Imaginary as a critical text, this course will
examine the role of race in the life of the mind, with particular attention to the
consequences of American racial conceptions in today’s literary, political, and
interpersonal spheres. What happens when, as one author writes, our imaginations are
“riddled with the stories racism built”? When “the voices least sanctioned to speak come
from the bodies most on display”? Or when an author is silent because “I’m afraid of
what I might say about race, afraid of examining what I think and feel about race”? We’ll
read a variety of texts—including James Baldwin’s memoirs, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah’s
criticism, and Eula Biss’s lyric investigations—in an attempt to address such questions,
and to learn how to better write about race and ethnicity ourselves. Students can expect
to pay significant attention to the research, drafting, and revision processes in this
writing-intensive class. Because this is a writing course, significant course time will be
spent on the writing process, with a focus on revision. Not open to students who have
previously completed the writing course (W) requirement and/or ENG 111. (Writing

ENG 111-3. Topic: Beats, Dylan and the American Dream (W)
In the 1950s, a period of American prosperity and social contentment and conformity,
the “Beats” rejected traditional American values. Writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen
Ginsberg, and William Burroughs sought out a new version of the American Dream. In
the early 1960s, Bob Dylan followed in their footsteps and went on to become one of the
most radical, influential voices of the 20th century. This class will explore the work of the
Beats and Dylan through aesthetic, historical, political and cultural lenses as a way to
explore our own sense of American values. Do these artists have anything to say to
Americans in the 21st century? What is the American dream now? We will focus on
critical reading and writing skills as we try to formulate our own responses to these
important questions. (Writing Requirement) FREEMAN
ENG 111-3. Topic: Crossing Boders (W)
This course will examine literature about crossing borders--cultural as well as national.
The course will focus particularly on the experiences of Indian and Arab women crossing
borders as immigrants, using historical, social, political, and cultural points of view.
Readings will include short stories and novels by and about women as well as non-fiction
accounts of women's lives (work, health and water, marriage and children, religion,
education). Emphasis on critical reading, writing and revision. Some attention paid to
writing style as well. Not open to students who have completed their writing course (W)
requirement. (Writing Requirement) REED
ENG 111-4. Topic: The Magic of Experimental Women Film Directors (W)
Women filmmakers experiment in dazzling ways in the free space of independent
cinema. We’ll learn about a few highly influential ones and develop skills for writing
about their work. Julie Dash, an African-American filmmaker, directed an awardwinning short film, Illusions (1982) reflecting on race/gender issues in 40s Hollywood,
and, later, Daughters of the Dust, which in 1991 was the first full-length film by an
African American woman director. Maya Deren, leader of the New York avant-garde
film culture at midcentury, theorized about film and created astonishing short films such
as: “At Land” (1944), “Meshes of the Afternoon” (1943) and “A Study in Choreography
for the Camera” (1945). Patricia Rozema delighted and inspired viewers and filmmakers
with her fantastical, quirky flight of fancy in I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing (1987),
voted one of the best Canadian films of all time. Throughout the course, students will
draft and redraft writings, from in-class writing to film reviews to essays and researchinformed critical projects. Students will learn how to search for film and cultural
scholarship, using sophisticated library resources. Challenging writing assignments will
help develop critical thinking and critical writing skills. Not open to students who have
completed their writing course (W) requirement. (Writing Requirement) HANKINS
ENG 111-4. Topic: Be Transformed: Fairy Tale Transformations, Cultural
Critique, and the Creative Process (W)
Fairy tales have ignited the imagination of children and salon readers, storytellers and
political activists, authors and film-makers. They have provoked vigorous critical
arguments: they have been dismissed as trite little (girl) stories or escapist fantasies,
viewed as illuminating the imperatives of desire, or as windows into the history of
childhood and the family, or as emancipatory dreams, or as creative powerhouses.
Typically ending with a happy resolution, they are nonetheless full of danger and
violence. Case in point: their role in Shakespeare’s tragedy Othello, the focal text of this
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

215

First-Year Writing course, which reworks the familiar “Beauty and the Beast” tale,
contains echoes from “Bluebeard,” and fragments from tales featuring slaves and
cannibals, an Egyptian witch, a maid from Barbary, and a conniving devil. Othello itself
has been re-worked in a variety of media and we will explore the narrative pleasures and
cultural critique afforded by two of these transformations: Bulgarian film-maker Ivan
Mladenov’s 2005 documentary Othello, shot in the prison of Varna, Bulgaria, with a cast
of the inmates, and the award-winning 1997 play Harlem Duet, by African-Canadian
feminist playwright Djanet Sears. Written assignments, including a paper involving
library research, will challenge your creativity and hone your analytical and critical
reading skills. Plan on daily writing, reflection on the writing process, and thoughtful,
transformational revision. Not open to students who have previously completed a FirstYear Writing Course. (Writing Requirement) STAVREVA
ENG 111-5. Topic: Be Transformed: Fairy Tale Transformations, Cultural
Critique, and the Creative Process (W)
Fairy tales have ignited the imagination of children and salon readers, storytellers and
political activists, authors and film-makers. They have provoked vigorous critical
arguments: they have been dismissed as trite little (girl) stories or escapist fantasies,
viewed as illuminating the imperatives of desire, or as windows into the history of
childhood and the family, or as emancipatory dreams, or as creative powerhouses.
Typically ending with a happy resolution, they are nonetheless full of danger and
violence. Case in point: their role in Shakespeare’s tragedy Othello, the focal text of this
First-Year Writing course, which reworks the familiar “Beauty and the Beast” tale,
contains echoes from “Bluebeard,” and fragments from tales featuring slaves and
cannibals, an Egyptian witch, a maid from Barbary, and a conniving devil. Othello itself
has been re-worked in a variety of media and we will explore the narrative pleasures and
cultural critique afforded by two of these transformations: Bulgarian film-maker Ivan
Mladenov’s 2005 documentary Othello, shot in the prison of Varna, Bulgaria, with a cast
of the inmates, and the award-winning 1997 play Harlem Duet, by African-Canadian
feminist playwright Djanet Sears. Written assignments, including a paper involving
library research, will challenge your creativity and hone your analytical and critical
reading skills. Plan on daily writing, reflection on the writing process, and thoughtful,
transformational revision. Not open to students who have previously completed a FirstYear Writing Course. (Writing Requirement) STAVREVA
ENG 111-5. Topic: Beats, Dylan and the American Dream (W)
In the 1950s, a period of American prosperity and social contentment and conformity,
the “Beats” rejected traditional American values. Writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen
Ginsberg, and William Burroughs sought out a new version of the American Dream. In
the early 1960s, Bob Dylan followed in their footsteps and went on to become one of the
most radical, influential voices of the 20th century. This class will explore the work of the
Beats and Dylan through aesthetic, historical, political and cultural lenses as a way to
explore our own sense of American values. Do these artists have anything to say to
Americans in the 21st century? What is the American dream now? We will focus on
critical reading and writing skills as we try to formulate our own responses to these
important questions. (Writing Requirement) FREEMAN
ENG 273-7. Topic: Introduction to the Digital Humanities
With new technologies, and with big data sets, the kinds of questions that we can explore

in the Humanities have expanded. New media also allows us to share results in new
ways. The Digital Humanities is an emerging, interdisciplinary field, creatively
combining knowledge and skills from humanities disciplines with information and
computer sciences in the spirit of inquiry. Students in this course will be introduced to
debates surrounding this new area of study, and will design and implement intro-level
Digital Humanities projects of their own. Recommended for computer science and
humanities students, but all majors are welcome. (Humanities) MOUTON
ENG 374-7. Advanced Topic: Medical Fictions: Patient-Doctor Dynamics in
Fiction and Film
Writers and filmmakers--even cartoonists--bring their art and insight to the medical
moment, illuminating doctor/patient connections and misconnections, writing about
empathy and abandonment, highly-charged moments of illness, dying, childbirth, shellshock, and other health experiences. Engaging with these powerful and moving texts
invites students to examine and deepen their concepts of the relationships between
health providers and others. The course will include a field trip to the University of Iowa
hospital to witness Project Art and visits from speakers, as well as a service project.
Prerequisite: writing-designated course (W), or ENG 201, 202, or 215. (Humanities)
HANKINS
ENG 382-3. Advanced Topic: Distinguished Visiting Screenwriter: Creating
Characters
Great films rely on great characters. In this screenwriting workshop, students will study
and explore techniques for creating their own dynamic, character-driven films with
special attention on using the tools of visual storytelling to create cinematic shorts with
memorable characters. Using a series of writing exercises as well as in-class readings
with actors, students will create and shape their characters from the ground up and then
place them into narratives that help define and, most importantly, reveal who their
characters are. Genre will be a secondary consideration as character takes center stage to
create compelling scripts that are honest, emotional, and even personal. Students will
not only write their own screenplays but they also will be expected provide thoughtful
and constructive feedback on all other students’ work throughout the development
process of the workshop’s scripts. Class participation, creative collaboration, and critical
thinking about other students’ work is essential to success in this workshop. Students
will create a 12-15 page screenplay that displays strong character development, with
additional focus on act/scene structure and visual storytelling film language. (Fine Arts)
ENG 383-6. Advanced Topic: Distinguished Visiting Writer in Live
Literature: The Personal is Political.
Sharing personal stories is a vital part of creating social change, but for creative writers,
trying to send a message or teach a lesson can drain a story of its value as art and/or
entertainment. The emerging nonfiction genre of “live lit”—short memoirs written for
performance—is an excellent medium for exploring the personal and the political in
creative work. How can we broach political subjects without coming across as excessively
preachy or wonky? How can we draw broader social points out of our personal stories,
without seeming “whiny” or narcissistic? What’s the difference between writing for the
page and for a live audience? Through workshopping, class discussion, field trips, and
performance practice, we’ll move toward balancing the persuasive power of a political

HISTORY
HIS 120-1. Introductory Seminar: Women in America (1600-1870 (FYS)
This seminar is an introduction to women’s history from colonial times through the Civil
War. We will examine a number of different topics such as the status of women in
different colonies, the effect of the American Revolution, slave women, the 1848 Seneca
Falls Convention, and the evolution of the women’s rights movement. Readings will
include biographies, slave narratives, and some of the most important historical
scholarship. One of the goals of the course is the improvement of writing skills, thus
there will be frequent writing assignments. (FYS)
HIS 334-1. Topic: Inquisitions in Medieval and Early Modern Europe
The Inquisition's dark reputation is well known. What reality lay behind it? This course
examines the development and growth of the inquisition over time, from its origins in
the 13th century as a group of largely independent investigators of heresy, through the
establishment of its more structured forms in 15th-century Spain and 16th-century Italy.
We'll consider the procedures, goals, and motives of the inquisitors, as well as of those
who had to defend themselves before inquisitors, and the impact of the inquisitions on
European society. Prerequisite: junior standing. (Humanities) HERDER

INTERDISCIPLINARY
INT 160-1. Cell-Phones, Coffee, and Cars: Critiquing Consumption
Life, as we know it, is dependent on the everyday consumption of goods and services;
however, our consumptive practices can also have negative social and environmental
consequences. This first-year seminar combines sociological and geological perspectives
to provide a unique viewpoint on the cause and effects of our consumer society.
Sociology allows us to examine the changing meaning, practices, and social implications
of consumption, while geology provides scientific insight into the physical processes and
environmental implications of consumption. Our goal is to examine the interdisciplinary,
complex nature of sustainability through reflection, experiential learning and
collaborative problem-solving. (FYS) DAVIS and WALSH

LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
LAS 236-4. Topic: Columbus revised (Bahamas)
This course introduces students to major events, which have shaped Latin America and
the Caribbean. The unique experience of studying in San Salvador, Bahamas, will allow
us to make connections between past and present. Students will be able to learn the
environment in the island and compare it with the landscape Columbus, the loyalists,
and the current inhabitants of the San Salvador Island. Students will have the
opportunity of study an interdisciplinary course abroad, re-thinking the Conquest and
Colony of the Americas, from Columbus and the Spanish ruling, to the British slavery
plantation times. Course readings, visits, films, lectures, and interaction with students
from other courses and areas would enrich the uniqueness of our own course.
Prerequisite: Sophomore standing. A non-refundable deposit of 10% of the course cost,

online system. (Humanities) OCHOA-SHIVAPOUR
LAS 349-7. Topic: Cuba: Collision of Cultures
In the 1940s, Cuban intellectual Fernando Ortiz compared Cuban culture to a stew called
“ajiaco.” In this stew – which is composed of Indian, African, and European elements –
each ingredient maintains its own particular flavors while combining into a new whole.
One can also continuously add new ingredients to the stew as it is being served, making
it constantly replenishable. Ortiz named this cultural synthesis “transculturation.” In this
course, we will use “transculturation” as a guiding concept to help us navigate our
analysis of Cuban history, music, film, literature, and politics. Prerequisites: Writing
course. (Humanities) MOSIER

MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
MAT 105-1. Counting to Infinity in 18 days (FYS)
The idea of infinity has fascinated humanity since the beginning of time. Small children
want to know what the largest number is and are amazed that there is no largest number.
In popular culture, Buzz Lightyear in “Toy Story” is associated with the phrase “To
infinity … and beyond!” But what is beyond infinity? For that matter, what exactly is
infinity? This course will investigate the mathematics of infinity as well as mathematics
and mathematicians in the context of their time and culture. Students will have the
opportunity to creatively investigate aspects of infinity that interest them. The
mathematics covered is accessible, exciting and mathematically significant. Students will
be expected to enroll in an online learning community and will receive ¼ additional
adjunct course credit for their participation during the fall semester. (FYS) FREEMAN
MAT 256-1. Topic: Mathematical Models in Biology
An introduction to the development, use, and analysis of mathematical models in the
biological sciences. Mathematical tools such as discrete and continuous dynamical
systems, linear algebra, phase portraits, stochastic algorithms that are necessary to
analyze and interpret biological models may be covered. Biological topics may include
single species and interacting population dynamics, modeling infectious diseases,
enzyme kinetics, and quantitative genetics. Prerequisites: MAT 120, MAT 121, a score of
at least 3 on the AP Calc AB exam, or permission of the instructor. (Mathematics)
SKORCZEWSKI
STA 255-5. Topic: Dealing with Data
Managing and interpreting an overwhelming amount of raw data is part of the
foundation of our information society and economy. People use computers and statistics
to translate, process, and visualize raw data, enabling new understandings that in turn
contribute new knowledge to the world. This course will look at these topics from both a
statistical and a computer science perspective. Statistics will inform the discussion about
what appropriate goals are for learning from the data and how the data will answer the
questions raised. The computer science perspective will help us figure out which goals
are actually feasible computationally, and how to achieve them. Same course as CSC 255.

MUSIC
MUS 109-1. First Year Seminar in Music (FYS)
The topic of "Opera and Film" has become one of the “hot” areas of scholarship in the
past fifteen or so years. Both opera and film use a conglomeration of other constituent
arts to create what Richard Wagner called a Gesamtkunstwerk or total artwork. (In fact,
many of the first efforts in film were derived from opera and more specifically, Wagner.)
My intention with this course is to explore the intersections between opera and film,
using theories and practices of both genres, as well as numerous specific examples of the
interplay between them. (FYS) MARTIN

PHILOSOPHY
PHI 105-1. Topic: The Morals of Our Stories (FYS)
This course will examine ethical theories and notions embedded in the discourse of
storytelling. Moral lessons and norms are conveyed in the pages as the tale unfolds and
the characters develop. Through the use of fable, fiction and film, the ethical principles of
major philosophical systems will be discerned and analyzed. As a first year seminar,
emphasis will be placed on academic expectations, coursework integrity, and vital critical
reasoning skills in writing and discussion. (FYS) MIGELY
PHI 109-1. Topic: Ethics and Climate Change (FYS)
The threat of climate change raises urgent questions about what we ought to do—i.e.,
questions about morality. We will spend some time considering climate science and
questions raised by controversy about that science. What should we believe about the
claim that human activity is threatening the climatic stability of our planet given
apparent disagreement about the truth of that hypothesis? We will also spend time
considering the moral challenges the risk of climate change generates: what is the nature
of our obligations to prevent harm to people distant in space and in time; what
responsibilities do nations of the industrialized world have to respond to threats
generated by climate change; what does it make sense for such nations to do given the
uncertainty of some outcomes of climate change; what should we, as individual citizens
of such nations, be doing? We will read material of all sorts about these questions—we’ll
look at scientific reports, economic analyses, and philosophical/ethical arguments, for
example—and talk and write about what we make of the issues. Students will be expected
to enroll in an online learning community and will receive ¼ additional adjunct course
credit for their participation during the fall semester. (FYS) WHITE

POLITICS
POL 251-4. Topic: Research Methods in Politics

POL 351-5. Advanced Topic: Political Parties and Organized Interests
Political parties appear in one form or another in virtually every aspect of American
politics and some argue that democracy could not exist without parties. Why do people
join groups such as parties or special interests and how do those decisions shape the
political world we know? This course examines the role of parties and interest groups in
American politics. In this class we will look at party formation, party processes, party
machines, pressure groups, and party identification in the electorate and how each of
these aspects shape the political process, political outcomes, and public policy. (Social
Science)

PSYCHOLOGY
PSY 243-1. Psychological Insights: Environmental Problems (FYS)
Human behavior is at the root of almost all environmental problems: We drive gas
guzzling cars (contributing to both global warming and depletion of natural resources),
produce tons of refuse, deplete water resources (build golf courses in the desert). This
course explores facets of psychology that can help explain why we act as we do and how
we might change behavior toward greater sustainability. We review some basic
psychological principles as they apply to the environment: What are the thinking
processes that lead some people to accept and others to reject concepts like global
warming? How do people develop their basic value systems, and how do things like
emotions and culture impact this? Even when people want to change their behaviors,
what are the barriers that make change difficult? Course includes an analysis and
application of these principles to a local issue. (FYS) GANZEL
PSY 244-4. Human Aggression & Violence (W)
This course will examine recent efforts to integrate explanations of human aggression
and violence across several disciplines. Students will consider the interplay between
social learning, neural, endocrine, and evolutionary explanations of aggression by
individuals in their social environment. Topics are likely to include interpersonal and
online aggression, workplace violence, aggression within competitive situations,
video/computer game violence, and war. In addition to analyzing both primary and
secondary sources, special attention will be given the depiction of violence across several
different forms of mass media. Because this is a writing course, a significant amount of
time will be spent on the writing process, with a focus on revision. Not open to students
who have completed their writing course (W) requirement. DRAGON (Writing
Requirement (W))
PSY 256-2. Topic: Culture and Contemporary Issues in Japan
This off-campus course, taught in Japan, examines the interconnections between
Japanese cultural traditions and contemporary issues. Cultural ideologies, social
practices, and public policies related to gender, race/ethnicity, and human rights will be
emphasized. Specific topics may include: gender roles; work and family life; intimate
relationships; interpersonal violence; birthrate and aging concerns; youth culture and
the current challenges faced by young adults; national identity; race/ethnicity,
immigration and human rights; historical preservation and urban development; and the
juxtaposition of traditional and popular culture. Initial sessions will provide an
orientation to enduring historical and cultural foundations and values as well as
contemporary issues that inform everyday life in Japan. While in Japan, class members

will participate in a variety of activities and discussions; will complete field excursions to
historical, cultural, educational, and religious settings; and will read materials relevant
to these themes. Students will also explore contemporary culture by observing and
interacting with Japanese citizens and hearing from guest lecturers. The course typically
includes travel to and within the Kyoto-Osaka (Kansai), Kanazawa, Hiroshima, and
Tokyo (Kanto) regions of Japan. Same course as SOC 249. Prerequisites: SOC 101, 102,
ANT 101, PSY 161, EST 123, GSS 171, or JPN 102. (Social Science)

RELIGION
REL 101-1. Introduction to Religion (FYS)
Our course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the study of religion and the
humanities in an academic setting. We will examine the relationship between thought
and experience, the meaning of the sacred in space and time, and the function of myth
and ritual as means to understand the commonalities and differences in and among
human individuals and cultures. (FYS) SACKS
REL 125-2. Topic: Biblical Hebrew
Introduction to the language of the Hebrew Bible and associated cultures of the Ancient
Near East. Students will learn the essentials of grammar, vocabulary, and culture
through reading selections from the Hebrew Bible and associated post-Biblical
literatures. No previous foreign language experience required. Offered every third year.

REL 359-7. Issues in Christianity in America. America: Christianity,
Democracy, and Religious Freedom
This course explores Christianity and religious freedom within the context of a dynamic
American landscape characterized by growing religious diversity, "geo-religious reality,"
and a democracy with its balance of majority rule and minority rights. The aim of the
course is to gain nuanced understandings of myriad perspectives so as to navigate
through the complexities involved in competing claims of personal religious pursuit and
religious freedom in the public sphere. In this course we will wrestle with such topics as
the role of religious authority, politicized religious pressure groups, equal rights of
conscience, respect and human dignity, and religious toleration. Offered every third year.
Not repeatable, even when topic is different. (Humanities) SACKS
REL 366-8. Advanced Topic: Uncanny Doubles and Counterfeit Selves
This course will examine the philosophy, mythology and psychology of "other selves" of
Gods, spirits and humans, including twins, doppelgangers, clones, the soul, divine
multiplicities and multiple personalities. Students will engage the meaning and
morphology of selfhood within the context of classical and modern sources.

SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
SOC 102-4. Topic: Sociology through Film and Media
The course is a version of Sociological Thinking (SOC 101) with a more specific topic
focus. This course will introduce students to the discipline of Sociology through Film and
Media. Sociologists study people in the world, looking at patterns, at differences, at
inequalities. Film and media present the world to us in specific ways and shape our view
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

222

of society. As such, media can be understood as a form of cultural practice, and in this
course we will use media as texts to explore the social world. We will view, discuss, and
analyze films and other media from a sociological perspective --examining the
consumption of media, the cultural meanings and practices presented, and the social
implications of such representations. We will also explore the extent and ways media
reflects, heightens, and/or challenges social patterns, differences, and inequalities.
Credit may be given for either 101 or 102, but not for both. Not open to seniors without
permission of the instructor. (Social Science) DAVIS

ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
All-College Independent Study Courses
No more than four All-College Independent Study course credits (280/380, 289/389, 290/390,
297/397, 299/399) may be counted toward satisfying the minimum credit requirement for the
Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Music degree. For students graduating in 2016 or earlier, no
more than two All-College Independent Study course credits (380, 389, 390, 397, 399) may be
counted toward satisfying the minimum of eight course credits numbered in the 300s or 400s
required for the B.A. or B.Mus. degree.
280/380. Internships (1/2-1)
Internships are experiential learning activities designed to provide students with opportunities
to make connections between the substance and methods of academic study and the application
of that study to work or service. Internships entail pre-professional work projects conducted
under the guidance of a practicing professional supervisor, and help students develop leadership
and service skills. Internships are sponsored by a Cornell faculty member and supervised by a
representative of the organization or firm where the internship resides.
Internships typically feature an agreement among the parties projecting student responsibilities
(including hours to be assigned); documentation of activity (e.g., daily journals, weekly reports,
and/or a final, reflective essay from the student); and evaluation of performance (including a
report from the supervisor on site. A valid internship will include a minimum of 40 hours of
participation per week for one month to receive one course credit and 20 hours of participation
per week for one month to receive one-half course credit.
Although some departments may suggest topics or put students in contact with prospective
employers, most students develop their own proposals and contacts. To enroll in an internship,
a student must file a contract endorsed by the faculty sponsor. The contract must be submitted
to the Registrar at least one week before the start of the Block in which the internship is to be
credited. Students must consult the faculty member whom they wish to have sponsor their
internship well in advance of the submission deadline. Internship credit will not be approved
retroactively. Printable forms are available from the Registrar’s Office web site.
Students should bear in mind the following when electing to participate in an internship:
•

•

•
•
•

International students on F-1 (student) visas should consult with the Office of Intercultural
Life to determine if the internship constitutes curricular practical training or off-campus
work.
Students participating in international internships must meet with the Office of
International and Off-Campus Studies to submit required documents and obtain
information about the College’s foreign insurance policy.
Expenses incurred (such as for transportation and lodging) must be borne by the student.
Students who receive financial compensation for their participation in an internship or
similar program may have their Cornell aid adjusted accordingly.
Students who are off campus Blocks 1 and 2 may not participate in room selection or
otherwise hold an on-campus room for first semester. Students should contact the Residence
Life Office the Block prior to their return to campus to confirm their housing assignments.

Internships are open only to students who have completed at least eight course credits, at least
two of which are in the same department as the internship. (CR)
289/389. Group Projects (1/2-1)
Two or more students who wish to organize a course of study in an area not normally included
in the regular course offerings may assume the responsibility for finding a faculty sponsor and
for drafting a contract to be approved by the Academic Standing Committee. Students may, with
departmental approval, design their own off-campus group projects (students should contact the
Office of Off-Campus and International Studies if they plan to complete independent study
abroad). To enroll in a Group Project, a student must file a contract endorsed by the faculty
tutor and the chair of the department. The contract must be submitted on a form available from
the Registrar's Office at least one week before the Project is to begin. Students must consult the
faculty member whom they wish to direct their group project well in advance of the submission
deadline. Group Projects are open only to students who have completed at least eight course
credits. Only those students who have signed the original contract may register for the course.
Projects may be either departmental or interdisciplinary; however, a Group Project may not be
used to meet any of the general education requirements for the B.A. or B.Mus. degree and does
not count toward a major unless specifically approved by the department concerned. A halfcourse credit in a Group Project is permitted only if taken in conjunction with another halfcredit course or with a parallel course. Exceptions must be approved by the Academic Standing
Committee. (CR)
290/390. Individual Projects (1/2-1)
Students may do intensive work in a subject or area not normally included in the regular course
offerings or else pursue in depth a topic encountered as part of previous studies. The
arrangement is that of a tutorial, in which the student works independently under the
supervision of a faculty tutor on a topic suggested by the student and approved by the tutor.
Individual Projects are open only to students who have completed the following requirements:
290 - a writing-designated course (W) and a minimum of seven course credits (at least two of
which are in the same department/interdisciplinary major as the Project); 390 - a writingdesignated course (W) and a minimum of fourteen course credits (at least four of which are in
the same department/interdisciplinary major as the Project). Individual Projects may not be
used to satisfy the specific course requirements listed as Part One of the general education
requirements for the B.A. or B.Mus. degree and may fulfill major requirements only if the
department approves.
Students may, with departmental approval, design their own off-campus independent research
projects. Students should contact the Office of Off-Campus and International Studies if they
plan to complete independent study abroad.
To enroll in an Individual Project, a student must file a contract endorsed by the faculty tutor
and the chair of the department. The petition must be submitted to the Registrar at least one
week before the start of the Block in which the Project is to be credited. Students must consult
with the faculty member whom they wish to direct their Individual Project well in advance of the
submission deadline. Forms are available from the Registrar's Office. A half-course credit in an
Individual Project is permitted only if taken in conjunction with another half-credit course or
with a parallel course. Exceptions must be approved by the Academic Standing Committee. (OP)

690. Special Studies
B.S.S. candidates have the option for one or more Blocks of reading on their own; auditing
courses; doing library or field research; working either as a volunteer or a paid employee with
public or private organizations; taking professional or vocational courses at other institutions;
traveling; or engaging in a creative endeavor involving writing, composing, performing,
painting, sculpting, etc. To arrange a Special Study course, the student must justify to her or his
faculty committee that the proposed experience is relevant to the student's educational
objectives as stated in the B.S.S. Prospectus and will materially help the student achieve these
goals.
Students who undertake a Special Study course (690) must file a Plan of Study with the
Registrar before the start of the Block. This is the contract for the Block and must be approved
and signed by the faculty committee. Special Studies projects may extend over two or more
consecutive Blocks; however, only one Plan of Study need be filed if only one project is involved.
Any changes in the Plan of Study after the start of the Block must be approved by the committee
and filed with the Registrar.
Students who file a Plan of Study at the beginning of a Block must also file a Progress Report at
the conclusion of that Block in order to receive a course credit for their work. The committee
determines whether the student has done what was proposed in the Plan of Study and either
signs the Progress Report (thus authorizing a course credit) or not, depending upon the
advisor's evaluation of the student's academic progress. Students who file a Plan of Study for a
multi-Block project need not file a Progress Report until they have completed the project, i.e., at
the conclusion of the final Block specified in the Plan of Study. Because the committee must
certify to the Registrar at the end of every Block that satisfactory progress is being made toward
the completion of the project, the committee may ask the student to submit periodic evidences
of such progress. The Progress Report, typed onto an official form by the Registrar and signed
by the student and the committee, becomes a permanent part of the student's transcript.
There is no limit to the number of Special Studies that a B.S.S. candidate may take. The
Registrar approves petitions (available from the Registrar's Office) to waive room and board
charges for one or more semesters (periods of not fewer than four Blocks) for a limited number
of B.S.S. candidates planning to undertake Special Studies outside Mount Vernon. (CR)

Summer Study
Students seeking credit for summer study begin by consulting a faculty member in the
department in which they wish to earn the credit, who can tell them whether the department
will sponsor their project and what, if any, prerequisites or other conditions must be satisfied in
order to obtain departmental approval. Although some departments may suggest topics or put
students in contact with prospective internship supervisors, most students develop their own
proposals and contacts.
To register for a Summer Study course, students must file a proposal with the Registrar,
available from the Registrar's Office, before leaving for the summer (the earlier the better in case
there is a problem obtaining the permission of the Academic Standing Committee). The
prospectus must be approved and signed by the faculty sponsor and the department chair. Late
or retroactive registration is not permitted.

1. have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 (unless a higher grade point average is specified);
2. be in good disciplinary standing with the College; and
3. be in good financial standing with the College.
The Office of International & Off-Campus Studies will request the appropriate information from
the Registrar, the Dean of Students, and Student Accounts Manager to determine a student’s
eligibility.
Students are responsible for contacting the Residence Life Office to discuss how off-campus
study will affect their housing assignments, especially for off-campus study which takes place
immediately following or prior to any college break.
Participants are responsible for knowing the regulations in this section as well as those
governing their chosen program. By the act of registering for a program, the student signifies
that he or she understands and agrees to abide by these regulations.

Cornell Off-Campus Courses
Cornell Off-Campus Courses are taught by Cornell faculty members in locations
throughout the U.S. and the world. Offerings are advertised each year in the Course
Schedule. Students must register for Cornell Off-Campus Courses in the same way that
they register for regular courses. (See also Registration)
1. All Cornell Off-Campus Courses require an additional course cost that is not covered
by either the regular tuition or financial aid. All published course costs are estimates
only and are subject to an increase or decrease in price (not to exceed 10% of the
original course cost) until 30 days prior to the start of the Block in which the course

5.

is to be offered. All courses require a 10% non-refundable deposit due within 10 days
of the close of the registration period during which students register for the course.
Students that have not made the initial deposit will be removed from the course and
receive a “no course” designation on their course schedule. Payment schedules for
each course are determined by the faculty instructor and/or the Office of
International & Off-Campus Studies and are published prior to spring registration.
Students adding an off-campus course after the registration period closes are
required to submit the deposit and any appropriate scheduled payment at the time
they add the course. Travel reservations will not be made for a student who has not
adhered to the payment schedule. Failure to adhere to the posted payment schedule
may result in removal from the course. (See also Adding and Dropping Courses,
paragraph 10.) Students may use their tuition exchange or remission benefit for these
programs.
Students traveling on Cornell off-campus courses are required to participate in the
group travel arranged by the Office of International and Off-Campus Studies. The
Office of International and Off-Campus studies will arrange travel to accommodate a
student wishing to extend their stay in the destination city/country provided that the
student: 1) secure permission from the course instructor and contact the Office of
International and Off-Campus Studies before group transportation has been
purchased and 2) pays any additional travel costs associated with the extended stay.
Initial eligibility is determined at the time the non-refundable deposit is made.
Students who have paid the deposit and are denied participation at the time of the
initial eligibility check will be refunded their deposits. Final eligibility is determined
one month before the course. If a student is placed on academic or disciplinary
probation (or financial probation, for students who have petitioned to apply their
need-based financial aid to a pre-approved program) between the time of the initial
check and the final check, his/her participation will be reviewed by the course
instructor, the Associate Dean and the Dean of Students. The student may be
removed from the course or may be given permission to participate with clearly
established guidelines. Should a student be placed on disciplinary probation after the
final eligibility check but prior to the departure date for the off-campus course he/she
will be removed from the course. Faculty members retain full discretion as to student
enrollment in their courses.
In addition to fulfilling all eligibility and payment requirements, students
participating in Cornell Off-Campus Courses are required to:
a. attend all pre-departure sessions held by the faculty instructor, Student Health
Services, and/or the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies;
b. complete and submit all documents required by the faculty instructor, Student
Health Services, and/or the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies; and
c. fulfill additional requirements, as defined in writing by the faculty instructor
and/or the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies.
Students who drop or are removed from an off-campus course are only eligible for
refunds of monies not already committed as a result of their anticipated
participation, less the non-refundable deposit. A student’s refund may also be
reduced if his/her non-participation in the course results in a higher per student cost
on an existing contract with a third-party organization (e.g. Tour Company).
Students who drop or are removed from an off-campus course less than 60 days prior
to the start of the course is scheduled to begin are liable for payment of the full cost

of the program. The Office of International & Off-Campus Studies will provide
information to assist students with their inquiries regarding changes to existing flight
reservations.
6. Students participating in Cornell Off-Campus courses are held to all policies and
procedures outlined in The Compass as well as any other guidelines outlined by the
faculty instructor. Faculty instructors, with assistance from appropriate college
administrators when requested/required, are responsible for evaluating the severity
of and responding appropriately to all misconduct occurring throughout the duration
of the off-campus course. Student misconduct on off-campus courses may result in
verbal warnings, written warnings and/or dismissal from the course. Return travel to
the college as a result of dismissal from a course is at the student’s expense. Any
behavior warranting a written warning or dismissal from the course must be reported
to the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies. Participation in future offcampus courses by students who have received written warnings and/or who have
been dismissed from off-campus courses will not be allowed unless a successful
agreement is made in a meeting with the student, the faculty instructor, the Dean of
Students and/or the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies.

Off-Campus Study through Outside Provider
1. Off-Campus Study courses or programs offered by outside providers are numbered in
the 900s [numbers appear in square brackets at the end of each description], and are
listed at the end of the Off-Campus Programs section.
2. Students who wish to study off-campus through an outside provider are required to
submit a Petition to the Academic Standings Committee in care of the Office of
International & Off-Campus Studies. Students should consult this Catalogue or the
Office of International & Off-Campus Studies to determine which petition is
required.
3. Upon approval, students must register for the program at the Registrar’s Office as for
any other course and notify the Registrar whenever there are changes.
4. All courses are considered electives. Students who wish to have one or more of these
courses count toward fulfilling their B.A. or major requirements must use a Petition
for Transfer of Credit to obtain written permission from the Cornell department
concerned and file this petition with the Registrar before beginning the program.
5. If, after a student has been accepted by the host institution, he or she drops out of the
program, the student is liable for any expenses the student's withdrawal caused the
host institution, the sponsoring agency, and/or Cornell College. Any student who
wishes to return to Cornell during the period when he or she was to have been a
participant in an off-campus program must make arrangements in advance with the
Division of Student Affairs and the Business Office.
6. Students who choose to be off campus during the second half of their senior year do
so with the full understanding that they may have to postpone their graduation to
August or later because Cornell's Commencement may occur earlier than the
completion of the off-campus program or earlier than the host institution can process
and forward their transcript to Cornell. The College assumes no responsibility in
such cases for the student's graduating with her or his class.
7. If, after completing the program, the participant does not re-enroll at Cornell, the
courses taken and the credits earned in the program will not be recorded on the
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

229

student's Cornell transcript unless he or she pays a processing fee of $100 for each
course transferred.

Programs Pre-Approved for Funding
Students may apply to have their need-based Cornell funding applied to programs that
have been approved by the Cornell faculty for listing in this Catalogue (approved
programs listed at the end of this section). All applications require a Petition to the
Academic Standings Committee for Off-Campus Study to be completed and submitted to
the Office of International & Off-Campus Studies by the first Monday in December of the
academic year preceding the start of the program. Students who are not approved for
funding by the Academic Standings Committee but who meet eligibility criteria may
petition for an Academic Leave of Absence to participate in an approved off-campus
study program (See Other Off-Campus Study below).
1. Students must be in good financial standing with the college in order to participate in
pre-approved off-campus programs. Initial financial eligibility will be determined at
the time the petition is submitted. Final eligibility is determined one month prior to
the start of the program.
2. Students must have completed at least eight credits prior to program start date.
3. The number given in parentheses after the title indicates the maximum amount of
course credit that will be awarded by Cornell; however, participants who do not take
or pass all parts of the program will receive credit only for the work actually
completed. Normally, students will not receive more course credits than the number
of Cornell Blocks encompassed in their program.
4. Students approved for funding receive Cornell CR (if C or higher) or NC (see Credit
by Transfer and Grades). The original grades will appear as annotations on the
student's Cornell transcript but are not calculated into the student's Cornell grade
point average.
5. The provider’s application, deposit, letters of recommendation, etc., should not be
sent to the host institution or sponsoring agency until the student has received
formal notification from the Academic Standing Committee that he or she has been
granted funding to participate. Admission to most programs is competitive and
requires the approval not only of Cornell but also of the host institution.
6. For these programs the College reserves the right to limit the number of students
and/or the amount of funding per student available for participation in any academic
year. The Academic Standing Committee considers each petition based on the
following criteria:
a. students who have received no prior support through financial aid or Cornell
funds, including campus programs and scholarships for off-campus study as a
Cornell student;
b. students who intend to go off-campus as seniors, as juniors, or as sophomores, in
that order of preference;
c. students who apply for ACM-sponsored programs;
d. the merits of the student's written statement of purpose, in which the student
describes the features of the program that are of special importance and explains
how the program relates to the Cornell course of study and to general educational
goals;
Cornell College 2016-17 Academic Catalogue

230

e. the merits of a recommendation (if supplied) from the program director, an
academic advisor, or instructor who can testify to the relevance of the program to
the student's studies, and who can comment on the student's ability to participate
successfully (academically and socially); and
f. the student's cumulative grade point average.
g. the student’s level of financial need.
7. For students approved by the Academic Standing Committee to have their needbased Cornell funding applied to the period of time the student is studying with the
affiliated program, the College will pay the program all or part of the student’s
tuition, depending upon the program charges. If the program tuition is less that
Cornell’s charges for the time period, however, no adjustment in Cornell charges will
be made. The costs of transportation, lodging, and meals are normally the student's
responsibility. Because each program is structured differently, students, before
making application, should ascertain the actual costs by conferring with the Student
Accounts Manager in the Business Office and the Office of Financial Assistance.
Students are not allowed to use their tuition exchange or remission benefit for these
programs.

Other Off-Campus Study/Academic Leave of Absence
Students who were not approved for funding to participate in pre-approved off-campus
programs or students who wish to study on programs that have not been pre-approved
by Cornell College may petition the Academic Standing Committee for permission to
participate on an Academic Leave of Absence at least 90 days prior to the start of the
program.
1. Students must have completed at least four credits prior to program start date.
2. Students will not receive more course credits than the number of Cornell terms
encompassed in their program.
3. Students will register for ALA 701 for international off campus coursework or ALA
702 for domestic off campus coursework.
4. Credits by transfer (other than summer school) while a student is participating in an
Academic Leave of Absence will only be accepted when approved in advance by the
Academic Standing Committee. Grades will be posted as transfer work, i.e., as
"Credit" only, provided grades of "C" or better are earned. Grades are not calculated
into the student's Cornell grade point average.
5. If approved by the Director of Financial Assistance, the Registrar and agreeable to
the sponsoring college or university, and if the duration of the program will not
exceed one academic year, the two institutions may enter into a consortium or
contractual agreement. Please contact the Office of Financial Assistance to determine
if you are eligible for an agreement and which type of agreement applies to your
program. Under either arrangement, the College will consider the student to be
enrolled at Cornell while participating in the approved program, and will provide any
federal and state financial assistance to which the student is entitled. Cornell-funded
scholarship and aid monies are not generally available to students participating in
non-affiliated programs. Because each program is structured differently, students,
before making application, should ascertain the actual costs by conferring with the
Student Accounts Manager in the Business Office and the Office of Financial
Assistance.

6. Students taking an Academic Leave of Absence will pay only the program costs,
unless Cornell is the credit granting institution, as we are for all ACM courses.
